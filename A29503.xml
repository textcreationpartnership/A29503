            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THIS ſmall Volume was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, humbly to crave the Acceptance of your late Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Conſort, that moſt truly Excellent Princeſs; who not only heard, but reliſhed Diſcourſes proper for her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification. Theſe preſent ones dare pretend only to an Attempt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb facs="tcp:104491:3"/> for ſuch a Purpoſe. But ſhe is for ever gone from hence, where her vertuous and pious Soul had neither Books nor Company good enough for its Entertainment! May her juſt Character be preſerved, freſh and fair, to the laſt of Time! may her goodly Preſence ſtrike the Imagination of every one who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into your Royal Palaces, that her exemplary Vertue, Piety, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Sweetneſs may never be forgotten there.</p>
            <p>Forgive me, Great Sir, if I for once lightly touch the Wound, not only of your own Royal Heart, but alſo of the Hearts of all your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, except here and there a Self-intereſted, weak and peeviſh thing, or two, in this matter, whatever they may be elſe-where.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104491:3"/>
            <p> But as this ſevere Providence hath brought with it a mighty Loſs, and not reparable to Your Majeſty one way; ſo hath it given you a mighty Advantage another; for all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Hopes which your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had divided between two, are now publickly veſted in, and ſettled upon Your Majeſty's Perſon alone. And we hope, and pray, that as God will continue your own Portion of his Bleſſings to you, ſo he will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold hers from you. So that now your force being doubled and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too, cannot probably be much longer reſiſted, by your haughty and malicious, though puiſſant Enemy.</p>
            <p>That God would continue and multiply his Bleſſings upon Your Royal Head, fill your Heart with Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Wiſdom and Integrity in all your Counſels, proſper your Arms for the Chaſtiſement of Tyranny, Violence
<pb facs="tcp:104491:4"/> and Injuſtice; for the Peace, Safety, and Univerſal Happineſs of your Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all <hi>Europe,</hi> is the conſtant Prayer of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT hath been my Aim in theſe enſuing Sermons, as it hath been always my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in all Diſcourſes of the like Nature, to repreſent the Duties and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Religion plain and reaſonable, that the real and great Advantage which it hath above all others may be manifeſt, and the Cavils and Contempts of irreligious Men may be put to ſilence and ſhame. Nor can I think, whatever ſome Difficulty may do, that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligibility or Abſurdity in any Religion ought to commend it to any; I am
<pb facs="tcp:104491:5"/> ſure it never will to inquiſitive, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and honeſt Men, who are the beſt, though infinitely the leaſt part of the World. Such, I mean, who ask Queſtions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine things in Religion, not to ſhew their Subtilty, or poſe Men, not to diſgrace ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Profeſſion, or to get room and eaſe for Licentiouſneſs, or to make themſelves and others greater Scepticks, and doubt, and droll more: but like the Noble <hi>Beraeans,</hi> to ſee whether things are ſo or no, that they may know more, and be ſatisfied in matters of ſo great Concernment, that they may not be abuſed, led into Errour, and kept there by Force, Confidence, or bare Authority. Such as theſe, I think, are to be taken care of, that they be not juſtly ſcandalized, or offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Religion. Nay, they are in the firſt place to be regarded, who are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſurely by God to be ſaved as well as the Vulgar; but may alſo be great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Inſtruction and Confirmation of others, and the Eſtabliſhment of the due Eſteem, and Reputation of Religion. Strange it is, that the weak, the ignorant, and the peeviſh, ſhould be treated with ſo much Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: but theſe ſhould be rudely put off with the wiſe Application of Not many wiſe according to the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, Where is
<pb facs="tcp:104491:5"/> the wiſe, where is the Diſputer of this World? or perhaps with the Reproach, and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites of Indifferents, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderminers of Religion.</p>
            <p>This way of teaching and preaching the Chriſtian Religion, as it is at all times juſt, and of ſolid Advantage to it, ſo is it now become neceſſary. There are very many in this Age, more than formerly, inquiſitive, knowing, uſed to a more accurate Exerciſe of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding every where in Divine matters, as well as Natural, Moral, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical. Theſe will not be put off with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, confuſed, figurative and obſcure Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor with falſe, uncertain, remote Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings; they will know what, and why they believe.</p>
            <p>And hitherto is very well, the preſent Age being happy in it, whatever others may pleaſe to think: And had it been thus for ſome Centuries before us, a Thouſand Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and Fopperies had never crept into Chriſtian Religion; which have already, and yet will coſt the World ſo vaſt an Expence of Labour, and fill it with infinite Troubles, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquietneſſes, to drive them out again, and reſtore our Excellent Religion to its native and primitive Beauty.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:104491:6"/>
            <p> But as that Occaſion of the Neceſſity of Clearneſs, and true Reaſoning in Religion is good, ſo hardly any thing can be worſe than the Licentiouſneſs of our Time, when the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men, (eſpecially of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any Wit or Breeding) have not only reſcued themſelves from the Slavery of Superſtition, and uſurped Authority, but ſhaken off even the natural Reverence of Mankind to true Religion, the ſublimeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Glory of Humane Nature: Nay, they have run further yet, and pertly taken up a mean Opinion and Contempt of it, and all that belongs to it, as being nothing but Craft or Pedantry. Now theſe Men muſt be knocked down by weighty Reaſon, (for they ſlight the Holy Scriptures) and expoſed to contempt themſelves, for gentler Dealing will not do.</p>
            <p>It muſt be ſhewn, that if they will make good their Title to the Man, they muſt be Religious and Chriſtians too: And that there is nothing more Reaſonable than a Chriſtian's Belief, and nothing in his genuine Religion not adulterated, unbecoming of God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Reaſon, if rightly ſenſed and underſtood; that it is the weakneſs or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its Doctors and Commentators, and perhaps ever will be in ſome Degree, if any
<pb facs="tcp:104491:6"/> thing in it appear, or be repreſented other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and that they have been infinitely to blame, who have been the Cauſes of Grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Diſſatisfactions in the minds of men, between Religion and Reaſon, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven made irreconcileable Quarrels between them, which ſhould cohabit with conſtant and mutual Endearments and Aſſiſtances. I hope, and am apt believe, that ſuch will be the next turn of Divine Providence, which inviſibly governs the World, that the Holy Writings will every Day receive more light, and Divine Truths, more clearneſs from another Method, than what moſt Men make uſe of.</p>
            <p>To conclude this ſhort Preface, I am of opinion that now Miracles are ceaſed, this way of teaching the Chriſtian Religion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a judicious Affection, and followed with a ſober and well governed Life, ſeems the principal means left in our Power, to reſtore it to its Beauty, Force, and juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Church of Chriſt to its Purity and Honour; which now (as it is ſaid) is crammed with conceited Drolls, Indifferents, and down-right Infidels; and in no part of Chriſtendom more, than where it appears with its greateſt External Splendor and
<pb facs="tcp:104491:7"/> Domination. This very bad Eſtate of the Church, I beſeech God to amend in his own time, and to introduce ſincere and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion, neither Theatrical, nor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical.</p>

            <p>I deſign from theſe words to begin (for little more can be done in ſo ſhort an Exerciſe) a Diſcourſe concerning Evil Examples; which I take to be one of the moſt general, and too effectual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of Reformation of Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104491:9"/> world with us: but it is as certain they had never been ſo numerous and multiplied, never ſo ſtrong and violent, never ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and laſting, were it not for the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and magnitude too of bad examples, perpetually paſſing before us, enticing and ſometimes hurrying us with great violence, even againſt reclaiming Reaſon and Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Conſcience. We ſet fire one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and like ſmothering Coals put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we increaſe the heat of our luſts to ſuch a degree, that at laſt they burſt forth into a flame; and that ſometimes ſo fierce, that no-body dares to approach ſo near as to allay or ſlacken them. <hi>Vivitur exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis.</hi> The rules of Mens lives for the moſt part, is what they ſee other Men do, not what they are taught, and what in ſober temper they dare not deny they ought to do. Precepts are of ſmall force againſt this, and are as little able to withſtand it, as a grave Senator with his wiſe and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orations, the rude charge of a Troop of boyſterous Soldiers.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſometimes examples of good and happy Influence, and we are not ſo far to diſcourage thoſe that are, or thoſe who are fairly inclined to be good Men, as to tell them, that they are all alone, and ſo always like to be; that they'll never
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104491:9"/> make one Proſelyte, and it is well if they can ſecure themſelves. For the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of a wiſe and vertuous Man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially joyn'd with a goodneſs of Nature, may move, and ſometimes effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Minds and Manners of thoſe who are conſtant witneſſes of it: but alas, it is a thouſand to one perhaps otherwiſe; and all to be expected, is, that if you live ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly and piouſly, ſome few will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, but rarely any imitate you.</p>
            <p>The number of good examples is very ſmall; and when we have in our view thoſe of both kinds, we are all more apt to run to the worſt ſide, by reaſon of the moſt unhappy inclination and pente of our nature. <hi>Quoniam dociles imitandis—tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus &amp; pravis omnes ſumus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which we may add the obſervation, that vertuous and religious men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a more modeſt, prudent and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved temper and behaviour: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, vicious men generally are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, active and bold; which ſeems to inconſiderate ſpectators (infinitely the greateſt number) witty, generous and pleaſant, yea and reaſonable too; becauſe reaſon ſhould precede confidence; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their examples make greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.

            <p>From hence we ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe a while concerning the general influence of bad Examples, and how migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an hindrance it is of the converſion and reformation of Sinners, and that under theſe heads:</p>

               <item>V. Make an Inference or two.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104491:11"/> I. What are the Reaſons why Examples are more powerfull than Precepts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently bad ones prevail eaſily againſt Precepts and Rules of Duty. They ſeem to be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Examples are more frequent than Inſtruction. For Inſtruction, the rules and reaſons of our opinions and practice, are met withall only in a few good Books, (the Bible in the firſt place) or in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and Lectures out of Pulpits and Desks, or in the Converſation of wiſe and vertuous Men. The firſt of theſe are ſeldom looked upon, except on the outſides, and it is a very few hours of their lives that the greateſt part of Men, and even of thoſe of Education and Leiſure, whoſe time lies upon their hands, ſpend in ſuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>What they do read is only ſomething of Wit and Fancy; or fine Words, and perhaps Filthineſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis not eaſily to be imagined how much the World would mend, if Books containing true and rational Religion, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Wiſdom, were put into Men's hands, and frequently peruſed by them; if it were but once the faſhion and humour of the Age, to furniſh their Libraries and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104491:11"/> Memories and Diſcourſes with the choiceſt Thoughts of the wiſeſt and beſt Men.</p>
            <p>The firſt place no doubt is juſtly here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Oracles of God, or the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of inſpired Men well proved and well underſtood; and it is as certain that the Books of the New Teſtament, or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion contain in them the beſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Dogms, both for Speculation and Morality that ever the World knew. But becauſe there are a ſort of Men who will ſuſpect Credulity or Cunning in the beſt Religion, or pretend to do ſo; it is to be wiſhed they would then at leaſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look into the Writings of thoſe, who have had no other Maſters but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light and Reaſon, and who have been in great Reputation for Wiſdom and Knowledge, for now many Centuries of Years.</p>
            <p>The Names and Sects of ſuch as <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Epictetus</hi> with his Commentators, and that excellent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> who may ſeem better to deſerve a Saintſhip than many fooliſh things in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are ſtill every where known and great. Their Morality though in ſome few inſtances defective, yet is generally excellent.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:104491:12"/>
            <p> And it hath been known often, where Men have been by reading their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhamed and reaſon'd into good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and reſtrained in bad ones, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mightily prepared for a great Eſteem, and reliſh of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is reaſonable to believe, that the Modern humour of calling, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even of the choiceſt Books of the wiſeſt Men, by the contemptuous Name of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry,</hi> and juſtling out the Study of Books by the pretended Study of Men (not to help to mend but to corrupt Humane Nature; not to avoid but to imitate Vices, which otherwiſe they had never known; not ſo much to ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Friends the honeſt and innocent, as to circumvent and ſupplant others) I ſay, that this modern Humour hath had a conſiderable influence upon the Degeneracy and Immorality of this Age; and is truly great <hi>Pedantry</hi> it ſelf, if want of reaſon and judgment be as it ought, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by that Name: And it may well ſeem to be ſet abroad, and with an Air of Manlineſs receiv'd, by ſome who could hardly write or read well, or at leaſt in no other Tongue than what their Nurſe taught them: like as ſome Faſhions have been invented to cover ſome natural or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly contracted Infirmities.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104491:12"/>
            <p> The Truth of the Caſe is, as I think, and which will do no harm to moſt Men to remember, that the generality of Men are the worſt Books that can be read, and the Study of good Books approved by the wiſeſt, which contain Men's Thoughts, Paſſions, Actions, Laws, Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, what Men have thought, done, and ſhould do, is the beſt Study of Men.</p>
            <p>Though the other too managed diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for honeſt and vertuous Ends is a great improvement for any, and even neceſſary for many Employments and Stations of Life. And then for Pulpit-Diſcourſes or others of the like Nature, they are but rare likewiſe in compariſon of Examples, which occur every Hour; and many of them too, as they ſometimes ſhould, contain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith more than of Practice; and when they are practical (to mention it by the bye) they are but too little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though they want not Eloquence, Reaſon and Judgment; or at leaſt ſuch both Matter and Dreſs as may be moſt proper for the Auditory.</p>
            <p>Finally the Converſation of wiſe and good Men is ſeldom to be had, few Men's Company being inſtructive; or elſe more in Matters of Speculation than Practice, more in other ſort of Knowledge, than in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104491:13"/> wiſe and uſefull Obſervation in practical Religion, and good Manners.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, Examples are in our view every moment almoſt, except we be of that ſmall Number who converſe much with the dead and the abſent, (I mean Books) and with themſelves. Which were it more frequent and intermixed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and diſcreetly with Experience and Converſation, would much ſecure us from the Corruption of the Examples of Vice and Folly; of which otherwiſe we are in very great danger by reaſon of their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, notwithſtanding the Precepts and Rules and Exhortations which are to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and hinder them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Cauſe of the greater Efficacy of Example above that of Precepts is, that Examples are Objects of Senſe and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but the Precepts or Rules of life only of Reaſon and Underſtanding. The Impreſſions of Example upon Senſe, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Corporeal Memory, are dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſtronger than thoſe of Precepts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Underſtanding. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our Paſſions, and then upon our Choice and Inclinations, that is, our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and we may truly add finally, upon our opinions. For there is not a perſuaſion in an Hundred, which is not the effect
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104491:13"/> more of affection and inclination than of reaſon and judgment.</p>
            <p>The ſenſe and meaning of Precepts are by few Men well conceived and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or but faintly and obſcurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are intellectual Objects.</p>
            <p>For which reaſon Hiſtory, but more eſpecially <hi>Biography,</hi> or the Hiſtory of the Lives of the moſt excellent Men in all kinds, where mental Endowments or the Qualities of Men's minds are repreſented as it were embodied with ſenſible Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, written by judicious and virtuous Men, ſeems the moſt proper and effectual Way, for the good Inſtruction of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third Cauſe of the prevailing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Examples, if we conſider the whole Life of Man together, is the early precedency of it to that of Precepts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. We are capable of obſerving and receiving great Impreſſions from, and imitating of Examples too, eſpecially of thoſe whom we love and eſteem, before we know what we do, or come to the uſe of any Reaſon; much more of ſo much as to underſtand a good Inſtruction or Precept.</p>
            <p>The firſt is from our very Childhood, the ſecond rarely comes before we arrive at an Age thought fit to manage an Eſtate,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104491:14"/> and it is well if we then ſee it. So that we have been under the power of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and are formed uſually by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are capable of the Diſcipline of an Inſtructor or Tutor.</p>
            <p>Whence it is that men ſeldom much change the Inclinations they have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that time; and generally if by good example and government we are well ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd and temper'd to that Age, or ſome few years beyond, we ſeldom prove at leaſt very bad. Although by long and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ill company and example, too great a part may be undone again, and ſometimes all ſpoiled, which is very rare, becauſe it is very difficult to obliterate thoſe early characters and impreſſions ſo often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of Darkneſs, but rather reprove them,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in that excellent Epiſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 11. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>From the good you'll learn good, among the bad you'll ſurely grow worſe:</hi> like to that of the Wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 20. <hi>He that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe; but the companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed. Aſpice quid faciunt commercia, venerat obſes.</hi> The Youth once was very innocent, behold what he is now; how ſtrangely changed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104491:14"/> by lewd company? <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate not thy ſelf to a wicked man. Theſe and ſuch like are the Sayings of the Scripture, and the wiſer ſort of men, which do but remind us of the efficacy of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon our manners, and that far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power and force of all Precepts, Inſtructions and Directions.</p>
            <p>Nor do I yet know how this prevalency of example may be prevented or remedied, but either (1.) by a more than ordinary felicity of temper from the birth, whereby we are enclined to uſe our Reaſon more than our Senſes, and are capable of giving Precepts and Examples too: or, (2.) by the providence and grace of God, which may happily order the condition of our lives, or even immediately work upon our minds, and particularly by afflictions: or finally (which is moſt in our own power) by ſome conſiderable retirement from too frequent and tumultuous converſation, and accuſtoming our ſelves to Reading and Thinking. That be ſpoken to the Firſt General; <hi>viz.</hi> the Reaſons of the Efficacy of Examples againſt Precept.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Second is, the Reaſons of the prevailing influence of bad Examples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt good ones. Why ill Examples do ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104491:15"/> much more harm, than good ones do good, we may obſerve theſe among others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Evil examples are infinitely more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous. We can hardly light upon a good one, we can hardly miſs a bad one. Good ones we can hardly ſee any, bad ones we cannot but ſee many. The High and the Low, the Rich and the Poor, and the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle too. It hath been thought indeed that this laſt ſort of men are generally the moſt Sober and Religious; becauſe great and rich men think themſelves above God and Religion, poor men below it. The one behave themſelves as if God Almighty da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to take notice of them, the other as if he would not; both equally miſtaken.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it ſo: yet Bad examples far out-number the Good among all ranks and conditions of men, though of different vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces according to their reſpective temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: of different particular Vices, but the ſame general want of the ſenſe of Vertue, of Conſcience, and the fear of God in all.</p>
            <p>And now if the number of Good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be ſo ſmall in proportion to Bad ones, how much greater will the influence of theſe certainly be? For if we obſerve, 'tis frequency and repetition of thoughts and affections and actions, which form our Manners. Thoſe Objects which we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104491:15"/> moſt frequently and generally converſe withall, which poſſeſs our thoughts, have the command of our affections, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our inclinations and actions. We ſeldom think or talk of, love, hate, deſire, delight in any but them.</p>
            <p>And this is the reaſon why in a Family ſmall or great, and in Palaces themſelves, the ſingle example even of one or two of the greateſt in it, though deſervedly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd and beloved too, doth ſo little good upon all the reſt; though it would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be far worſe. It is becauſe they are very many againſt one. And how much leſs is it to be expected that in a place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of many ſcores or hundreds of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, the example of one or two whoſe buſineſs it ſhould be to back their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with good ones, ſhould have any viſible good effect, unleſs their number be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (which would become the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and Civil care too) or ſome more be pleaſed to give their aſſiſtance, and make up a number.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But Secondly, the Greatneſs of bad Examples is another cauſe of their greater influence. I do not know but that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their number, there may be as many Religious and Vertuous perſons in the Superiour as in the Inferiour Ranks of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104491:16"/> men, and that with more judgment and generoſity: But ſtill the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of the Great, the Potent, the Honourable, the Rich (the more is the pity) are of the bad ſide. Though in the whole lump of all ſorts of men put together infinitely the Major part (in their practices at leaſt) ſhould vote for the licentious and vicious ſide; yet it would not have near the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it now hath, were not the Major part of the Great on that ſide too, and of the ſame Party to head and lead them. So that it appears, it is not only the number of Voters, but alſo the power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, that makes ill example go ſo far and prevail ſo much. Were it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the vulgar and inferiour ſort only to be Irreligious, Immoral and Diſſolute, we ſhould ſoon ſee that Party decreaſe and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſert both in inward Principles and outward Practices. One excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a great Man would be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, outweigh a great number of ſmall ones. The generality of men far from wiſe, firſt eſteem the Men and then the Manners. At leaſt the dignity and height of a vicious man makes that Vice ſeem little and tolerable if not honourable, which were it only ſeen in thoſe of lower place, would be thought contemptible and puniſhable.</p>

            <p>We admire men for their power, pomp and wealth, and then all that belongs to them, leaving not out their very vices too. Like as the <hi>Pagans</hi> of old, not only deify'd their Heroes, but built Temples and erected Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars to ſome of their flagitious actions and abominable crimes; as <hi>Tully</hi> ſomewhere complains.</p>
            <p>On the contrary the poor and mean man's actions, according to the Wiſe-man's little Hiſtory <hi>(Eccl.</hi> 9. 14.) though never ſo wiſe and beneficial too, for that very reaſon are not heeded or ſoon forgotten.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is Truth and Reaſon, and not vulgar opinion only, that Power and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Ability to effect and bring to paſs, is to be honoured; but then Wiſdom and Goodneſs, which are to direct and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that Power, deſerve it much more. It is true, Wiſdom and Goodneſs without Power are moveleſs and ineffectual things; but then Power without them may be moſt miſchievous. Goodneſs without Power if it can do no good, yet it can do no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104491:17"/> harm: But power without goodneſs may be uſed to make miſerable, if it be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Cunning, Pride, Malice and Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature.</p>
            <p>But above all is that Perſon honourable and amiable, where Greatneſs, Wiſdom and Goodneſs are in Conjunction, as it is in God with Infinity. The Examples of ſuch work marvellous Effects in their Sphere, and carry all before them. They have great force to change the very inward Springs and Principles of Men's Actions, their Opinions and Inclinations; at leaſt they outwardly bind them to their good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. And oh! that Heaven as it hath begun among us, would go on to bleſs the World with ſuch an Happineſs, and refreſh the Souls of Righteous men, grieved and tired with wicked Generations, by ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and lovely a Sight. And here we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſs to make the Obſervation, how much greater obligations the Great are under, to look at their Conduct and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, than others, and how much larger their Account will be for the Evil they have, and the Good they might have done, and what can be ſaid by thoſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who becauſe they are great already, will be greater than God himſelf who made them ſo, and take that liberty which he never uſed?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:104491:17"/> 3. A third Cauſe of the greater influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of bad Examples is their Confidence, Promptneſs and Fierceneſs. Good men more generally (unleſs they be very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Gifts of Eloquence, quick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and Courage all together) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Caution, and conſequently are more ſparing in their Speech and Actions, more modeſt in their Affirmations, more tender of the Reputation of their Conduct, more carefull of their own peace and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, more ſollicitous concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of their Examples.</p>
            <p>Now the confidence and boldneſs of bad Examples, is uſually accompanied with ſome Wit and Freedom of Speech and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſome Paſſion, always with more vigour and life. Which things are more diſcernible and acceptable to moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, than good Senſe and Reaſon; and often make ſo great an impreſſion, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to force themſelves upon thoſe who aſſuredly know much better.</p>
            <p>There is alſo in ſuch Confidence a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain heedleſneſs and negligence, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Air and Appearance, and is ſome ingredient of Generoſity and Courage, which firſt much commends the Perſons, and then their Diſcourſe and Actions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to thoſe who are their Equals or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104491:18"/> Inferiours, and are no wiſer than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; though in other Circumſtances where it may ſeem exceſſive or unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to underſtanding Men it is uſually as offenſive. Finally the confidence of bad Examples to the greateſt part of Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, is a ſign of aſſurance of Truth and Reaſon in what they ſay and do; at leaſt of no great harm or folly; but where the former inclinations to imitation are back'd by appearing Reaſon, its force is irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, Calmneſs and Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs ſeem lifeleſs, dubious, cowardly; and even when they are thought to be the Effect of Wiſdom and Judgment; yet they are gratefull but to very few of the ſame temper, and the Examples of ſuch reach the Generality with no force, or with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little impreſſion.</p>
            <p>Whence good Men may be adviſed, that there is place and reaſon ſometimes for Freedom and a handſome Confidence in converſation (though many very wiſe may want that faculty) managed with a regard to the Meaſure, Seaſonableneſs and other Circumſtances, and with a Deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey as opportunity may ſerve, ſome good ſentiment and inſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is a laudable and uſefull Dexterity in converſation, to communicate wiſe and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104491:18"/> vertuous things with advantage, and to convey it acceptably, and particularly with a ſeeming heedleſneſs of what one is doing, when indeed it is the main Deſign to do it well: like as the diſcreet Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian may ſeem to his ungovernable Patient to be doing nothing of conſequence, when he deſigns the adminiſtration of ſome effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Remedy for his Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt Cauſe we ſhall name is the moſt general Corruption of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſiſting principally in prevailing Inclinations to other Objects, above thoſe to Religion, Vertue and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The depravation and vitioſity of our active Powers is this, that thoſe Appetites and Inclinations, which ſhould be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, governable and ſubſervient, are the moſt violent, ungovernable and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>Though this Cauſe be very general, yet it is not remote, but near and immediate. This is the reaſon why, ſuppoſing good and bad Examples equal in number ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and recommended alike advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, we ſhould, except here and there one ſecured by a rare Felicity of Temper, or the Grace of God, without much deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration enter our ſelves into the worſt Company.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:104491:19"/>
            <p> This is the reaſon, why, if Orations could be made with equal ſeeming Reaſon and Eloquence for Vertue and Vice, and we were the Moderators perfectly left to our own liberty without the reſtraint of ſhame, we ſhould ſoon heartily determine againſt Vertue. This is the Reaſon at the Bottom, why one ſingle Example of one great Man hath more influence than twenty of the prudent and vertuous, the wiſe and the good. 'Tis becauſe our very opinions, as well as our practices, are perverted and corrupted. We eſteem, admire, and love Power more than Goodneſs, to be great rather than good, to do what we liſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than what we ought. And then our general Veneration and great Opinion of the Great, inclines us to a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Approbation and Imitation of what he is and doth. 'Tis from this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable inborn Propenſion of our Natures to Vice, heavy and forcible, that if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the moſt excellent and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Examples, we are a little heaved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that's all, and we preſently flop down again all at once.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes they do not in the leaſt move us; and all their beauty and luſtre no more affect us, than if we were deaf or blind. 'Tis from hence till it be changed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104491:19"/> that like the filt by Swine, we will never learn to be cleanly, though in the Midſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f a verdant Meadow covered with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Sheep, if there be but one Puddle where we may wallow in the Mire; or like ſome naturally clowniſh and ſlovenly People, who will never be taught any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Carriage and Manners, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Company of thoſe who are gentile and well-bred. Oh the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pravity and Degeneracy of Mankind! deſperate and utterly incurable without a mercifull Touch by the Finger of God, and the ſpecial powerfull Influence of his Grace, preventing, following, aſſiſting our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Prayers, and ſerious Endeavours, without which the Company of Heaven it ſelf would never mend them.</p>
            <p>They would ſtill retain the Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Inclinations, nay the Actions too if they could, of Devils and Brutes in the midſt of Saints and Angels. Theſe are ſome of the moſt conſiderable Cauſes of the prevalency of evil Examples againſt good ones, in Anſwer to the ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How do theſe evil Examples ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? This is convenient to be known, that ſo we may the better prevent or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104491:20"/> their miſchievous Influence. The ſeveral ways may be obſerved to be ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By their Number, Variety and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. They take up all our attention and obſervation; they wholly poſſeſs our thoughts. Evil examples are oft-times like the ill-deſigning Companions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours of ſome great Man not over-wiſe, who will not permit any other Company but themſelves to approach him, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to hear or know much more, than he hath from them. Sometimes we may be ſo unhappy in our almoſt conſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as to have little occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any thing that is good, or not ſo much, or ſo often as to make any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There are ſome Perſons ſo brought up, ſurrounded always with ſuch Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that folly and vice are their perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al entertainment, ſcarce ever hearing a wiſe Word, or ſeeing a wiſe Action. Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and curſing, and brawling, and railing, and drinking, and gluttony, and trifling, and dreſſing, and gaming, and wantonneſs, and at the beſt worldly drudgery or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are ſet before their eyes, and upon their ears perpetually. They rarely hear but the very Names of Conſcience, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Vertue, of Sobriety and Piety,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104491:20"/> of Prayers and other Exerciſes of Devotion. They ſcarce know whether there be any ſuch men or things in the world.</p>
            <p>And it ſeems very likely, that were it not for the conſtant Publick Exerciſes of Religion and Divine Worſhip; Piety, and Devotion, and Conſcientiouſneſs, and all other Vertues, but what are more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately neceſſary for civil Society, for men's Dealing and Traffique one with another, would be ſo far neglected and thruſt into corners, ſo little any-where appear, that thouſands more would in a ſhort time be ignorant of there being any ſuch things at all. As it is now, how many are there who hardly ever ſee (ſo as to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of) a pious well governed Family or Perſon, and when they do, they ſeem to them like Foreigners from ſome ſtrange Countrey, with an unknown Language, an uncouth Garb, and odd Manners; nay perhaps ſome would ſeldom hear of a God or Jeſus Chriſt, but in Oaths and Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Corruption and Degeneracy of the Gentile World in ſome parts of it, was ſo great before the Preaching of the Goſpel and the Doctrine of Chriſtianity came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that they wondred at the Chriſtians for abſtaining from the moſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104491:21"/> abominable ways in which they ſecurely walked, of laſciviouſneſs, luſts, exceſs of Wine, revellings, banquettings, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatries. Nay they did not only think their Manners very ſtrange, but they revil'd them for them. Their ſober and vertuous Lives were not only matter of their wonder, but of their Reproach (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4.) they had never ſeen nor been uſed to ſuch things before. And it is beyond doubt, that there is but too much of this amongſt thoſe, who have indeed been admitted Members of the Church, and bear the name of Chriſtians. From the time they were firſt entred by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rite, they have heard little, ſeen leſs, and practiſed leaſt of their Religion. The Families, and Relations, and Acquaintance among whom they have been brought up, living more like Heathens than Chriſtians, and that none of the beſt ſort of Heathens neither. And what can be ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from thoſe of any thing that is good, who have ſcarce ſeen any thing but what is evil?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) But among others who have had ſo far the happineſs of better Inſtruction and Converſation, that they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant, or ill inclined, or inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of what is good and vertuous, evil
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104491:21"/> examples ſoon bring moſt of them over to Imitation, by taking away the reſtraint of ſome ſhame and fear, which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under. Few perſons at the beginning of evil courſes, are ſo hardy and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isent, as not to ſtand in ſome awe both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; of their own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other mens opinions concerning them, and the conſequences of them. As bad as our Natures are, there are very few who do not at firſt boggle at many vices; they bluſh and hang back at them. Such as are Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Laſciviouſneſs, Prophaneneſs, Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Contempt of the wiſe, ſober and grave, or in general of their Superiours. But let but two or three of the bolder and worſt of them begin, and how ſoon ſhall you ſee the reſt to follow; and when their number is increaſed to a multitude, how fierce and inſolent do they ſoon grow? They are backward and cowardly oft-times, till they are entred into villainy by ſome experienc'd Practitioners, or by ſome one of note who leads them the way; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps being once entred they go beyond their Patterns, and outdo thoſe who taught them. Now when once natural modeſty, ſhame and fear of the reproof of their own Conſciences, whether well or ill informed,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104491:22"/> and of the judgments of others are taken out of the way, then thoſe, as natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to the vices of evil examples have more their liberty, take their ſwing, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> their very motion gather ſtrength and celerity. We ſee in a Rabble got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a riotous and unlawfull manner commanded by Authority to depart, every one afraid at firſt to diſobey or affront it, till one more impudent and fierce than the reſt makes an attempt. And the violence of Robbers at firſt trembles more than they whom they ſet upon and rifle. And amongſt the moſt deſperate and bloody Ruffians hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to murder ſome perſon of Innocency, Eminency and Merit, every one is afraid to ſtrike the firſt ſtroke; but that being once given, the reſt ſoon fall on.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Evil Examples work their effect not only by removing and taking away the ſhame of Vice, but by making men aſham'd of Vertue; and this eſpecially when they are numerous and great. They make men aſhamed and afraid to be vertuous and good, both poſitively and negatively; both to do that which is good, and not to do that which they know to be evil. Men well diſpos'd and enclin'd are oft fearfull to give offence, to appear ſingular, to break company, even when their conſcience and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104491:22"/> diſcretion tells them, they omit to do what they ought; and what they do is not only fooliſh, but plainly unlawfull. Although the Man who thus practiſeth be not ſo bad as he that gives a bad Example, or is as ready to follow as the other is to begin; yet he is far from being ſo good as he ſhould be; nor indeed if it be his habitual Temper and more frequent Carriage is he to be deemed a good Man. For it is a ſign he fears the diſpleaſure of Men, more than that of God, and <hi>loves the Praiſe of Men, more than the Praiſe of God</hi> (John 12. 43.) like the chief Rulers who believed on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, but dared not to confeſs and own him. We are generally like the ordinary ſort of Soldiers in the Field, who either very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly change ſides at any time with their Commanders and Comrades, (which is a further ſtep ſtill) or elſe at leaſt they are afraid of the reproach of their Company. Whereas we ſhould heartily engage in and eſpouſe the Cauſe of Vertue and Religion, and then ſtand to it: that if it be poſſible we may keep others from deſerting them, or recall them again. The truth of it is, we want courage generally in ſo juſt and honourable a Cauſe, when we do not want ſome Approbation and fair Inclination to it. Which if it ſhould be ſaid to ſome Men in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104491:23"/> other matters, would hardly be let paſs without a challenge. We want ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to follow Vertue and Piety boldly. We are much more fooliſh and timorous in our Manners than our Faſhions, for we will not follow theſe if we find them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper or inconvenient for us; but thoſe we generally do, though in our diſcretion and conſcience we condemn them as foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and hurtfull, both to them who lead and follow too. It would make an honeſt Man of ordinary Spirit aſhamed, to ſee thoſe who will take no other Affront but upon the point of a Sword, to ſneak and be cowardly in the Cauſe of Vertue and Goodneſs, which they themſelves juſtly eſteem. We not only dare not draw our Swords (that's not deſired) but not ſo much perhaps as ſpeak in their behalf, when they are unjuſtly reproached and deſpiſed. We draw in our heads (indeed ſilence may be in ſome Caſes both moſt proper and fit) or rather take part with their Enemies, and ſecond perhaps their jeer with ſome conceited humorous Wit of our own, and this as hath been ſaid to pleaſe others againſt our own Conſciences. Thus evil Examples ſeem principally to keep us bad, and make us often appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed worſe than we inwardly are: but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104491:23"/> there is great danger if we ſtill keep ſuch company, and uſe ſuch practices, we ſhall really ſoon be as bad as we ſeem. But,</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The operation of evil Examples is yet more immediate to fix, or to alter, and change the very Temper and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our minds, and in great part our opinions and judgments.</p>
            <p>The great proneneſs of our Nature to imitation every one knows, and 'tis one of the firſt ſigns of reaſon which appear in Children. And if there be no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar impediment in our Nature (much more if there be any diſpoſition to it) we take that firſt which firſt comes, and moſt frequently preſents it ſelf to us. Thus we act, we ſpeak, we chuſe, we delight in, we hate, we admire, we deſpiſe as we ſee others do, (eſpecially thoſe whom we love and eſteem) without any deſign of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and we do not obſerve or know it our ſelves, unleſs others take notice of it and tell us ſo. We hear Children and young People, and thoſe of inferiour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at every turn, ſaying, they love ſuch a thing as their Eye, and they hate to do this, or that, (the one perhaps a trifle, and the other good or of no great harm) for no other reaſon, but becauſe they have often heard others their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours ſay ſo.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104491:24"/>
            <p> Now if we often ſo ſpeak, act, chuſe, reliſh, love, hate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it ſoon begets in us habitual Inclinations to, or averſations from certain Objects, and in time ſo ſtrong and obſtinate, that we cannot for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be, or do otherwiſe, nor ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weaken or deſtroy them, but in a long time, by a great change of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our conditions, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace and aſſiſtance of God himſelf. And theſe habitual Inclinations are called our manners, our temper and conſtitution of mind; by which we are, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good or bad Men. According to theſe we are eſtimated, and ſhall be treated by God, who better knows them than we do our ſelves. Now our manners being in this faſhion corrupted by evil Examples and Converſation, our opinions and judgments will at leaſt in great part be ſoon ſuitable to them.</p>
            <p>It is in the power of Man to believe what he liſts, unleſs it be ſome immediate Axiom; ſuch as the whole is bigger than its part. And even there too a Man may confound, darken, perplex, and indiſpoſe his mind in ſuch manner, as not to diſcern ſo clear a Truth; and then he can much eaſier turn himſelf away from regarding it, and conſequently he can ſuſpend his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104491:24"/> judgment, or not actually belleve it if he pleaſe.</p>
            <p>It is naturally conſequent to all other Inclinations, to be enclin'd to believe and judge that to be true, which may moſt gratify and pleaſe them. When therefore by evil Examples we are ſwayed and bent to that which is Evil, and brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, we will perſwade our ſelves contrary to what we thought before, that it is even laudable, or at leaſt of no great harm, and therefore tolerable, and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of jeſt more than Reproof.</p>
            <p>Our Luſts and unlawfull Affections by the Influence they have upon our Wills, bribe our very Conſciences, and bring them over to plead and argue on their ſide, or at leaſt to excuſe and extenuate them; to call Evil good, and Good evil, put Darkneſs for light, and Light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe are defiled Conſciences, as the Scripture ſpeaketh: and how deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the condition of ſuch Men, whoſe light is worſe than darkneſs, and whoſe very guide betrays them, and leads them to ſure deſtruction, not ſuſpecting or fearing any ſuch matter. Beſides our opinions are changed by evil Examples another way. Moſt men have no other reaſon for their practice, to believe it lawfull or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104491:25"/> wiſe or fooliſh, but only the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of their own Conſciences, and the Teſtimony of others. Now evil Examples invalidate both theſe, and firſt the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of others againſt any Vice. When we ſee ſo many confidently and ſecurely indulge themſelves in it, we are apt to believe, that they think it a paſſable or commendable thing. And as they ſeem to think no worſe of themſelves for it, ſo will they not of us; and a great many more may be of their mind. And then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it weakens the credit of our own Conſciences with us too. We begin to ſuſpect, and at laſt we conclude, that they have been hitherto but ill informed; that we are ſuperſtitious and more timorous than we need to be, through natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Education, want of uſe and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>Thus by this time we may more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly ſee the ways, how evil Examples make their attacque upon us, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of their proceedings, and being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand adviſed and admoniſhed thereof, we may, if we in good earneſt be willing, and wiſe, prevent their moſt dangerous and ruinous Influence upon us.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:104491:25"/> IV. In the Fourth place, I am to give a Caution or two to be obſerved in Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance with evil Examples, to ſecure our Prudence and Innocency: They are but two. (1.) In reſpect of the matter of our Actions. (2.) In reſpect of their End.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As to the matter, the moſt general Advice is, that we be well aſſured, that the Examples be really evil. One of the moſt certain ſigns of which is, a thing's being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally forbidden in the Scripture, and if we can be equally aſſured of it by true Reaſon too. That which is prohibited by God univerſally, hath certainly in every particular Action more miſchievous than good effects; though we may not ſee it at preſent our ſelves, or be able to make it appear to others; and therefore it is not at any time to be done. As contrariwiſe, that which is univerſally commanded hath more good than bad, and therefore is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be omitted. In things therefore that are thus forbidden or commanded, compliance with others, to do, or not do as they would have us is never juſtifiable. If Company, Converſation and Cuſtom deſire us, and God forbid us; if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us, and God command us, it is no queſtion, whom we are to follow.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:104491:26"/>
            <p> But becauſe we are oft-times liable to great miſtakes, we are hear to endeavour ſincerely to be well informed, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adviſed. We may judge that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally forbidden or commanded by God, which truly is not ſo. We are to avoid ſingularity through ignorance, or miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in our Duty, and conſequently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a needleſs offence, and expoſing our ſelves to the contempt of the ill-natur'd and ungenerous, or to the pity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of the beſt ſort of men for our weakneſs or ſuſpected Contumacy and Self-will; ſometimes to the loſs of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advantages, whereby we may not only live comfortably, but perhaps very uſefully. And then we are with the ſame ſincerity to judge as truly on the other hand too, and not to believe that lawfull which is really forbidden, or that not to be commanded which is really ſo: and conſequently to take an undue liberty, and in a more proper and important Senſe give offence. And becauſe of our general proneneſs to indulge our ſelves, and live eaſily, we have more reaſon to be vigilant and carefull over our ſelves in this laſt Extream.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Caution is in reſpect of the End. We are to take care (and there
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104491:26"/> is need of it) that we refuſe not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to, and follow received Practice and common Example, or to comply with company at any time, no not in things materially evil, out of pride or affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſingularity; not out of an humour to contradict the World, and controll o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to be leaders, not followers; not out of a deſign to be pointed at and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſuch an one will not do ſo; not out of a ſly intention to be known, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, eſteemed as a Man of Courage, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, Self-government; not out of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unwillingneſs to gratifie others. Theſe are all naughty and ill principles and ends, which defile and pollute, otherwiſe materially and eventually very good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Actions; and are very apt as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. So here to creep into our minds; and either to thruſt out, or at leaſt mix themſelves with thoſe that are worthy, juſt and reaſonable. There are ſome, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many ſpecious, external Carriages and Behaviours, to which men pay a great deal of Reverence, which have no better Spring, at leaſt in great part. Whence then muſt our diverſity of manners from the evil Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the reſt of the World proceed? From Charity to the World, becauſe thou ſeeſt ſuch Courſes and Carriages to be foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104491:27"/> unworthy of Men or Chriſtians, nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious and miſchievous; from prudence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou knoweſt them to be unworthy, or unbecoming thy ſelf, nor uſefull, nor ſafe; but indecent, troubleſome, hurtfull, and of dangerous, bad conſequence here, and hereafter: In few words, from Piety, Charity, Prudent Self-love, and Care of our ſelves. Our Carriage and Conduct here will be very beneficial and effectual, if the ſame Spirit and Temper appear in the reſt of our Converſation, ſhewing our ſelves generous, and civil, and eaſie, and willing to comply, and gratify in things which are not unlawfull or very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, or have no good reaſon againſt it. And even where we refuſe ſinfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious Compliances, we are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unwilling to give offence, or not to gratify; but that our Charity to our ſelves and others, and even to our Companions themſelves: Our prudence and our Duty to God, oblige us neceſſarily ſo to do.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Caution we muſt take care to avoid two Extreams. The one Pride; which word and vice I take ſo generally as to comprehend all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of affectation of ſingularity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſt before warned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, as ſo many kinds, and many
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104491:27"/> more which may be named. The other is too much ſoftneſs, too great loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to offend or diſpleaſe for the preſent, either out of love or fear; when we know in our Conſciences, that it will be better for the future, both for them and us, not to gratifie or comply with them: and to this infirmity that which we call good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (otherwiſe a valuable thing) is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, an will often betray us, if we do not (as we ought, all other natural diſpoſitions and inclinations) regulate it by a judicious and reſolved Vertue.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The fifth and laſt thing to be done is, to make an inference or two from what hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are with great care to avoid gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bad Example. Certainly good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is a good thing, if there be any in the World; and to corrupt a thing ſo good, ſo abſolutely neceſſary to any tolerable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in this or any other State, is the worſt of Employments. Now the giving bad Examples tends to it, the following of them effects it. If any be ſo wicked as deſignedly to give an ill Example in any Vice (ſuppoſe Irreligion) and to make it their ſtudy or diverſion to corrupt the World.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:104491:28"/>
            <p> This ſeems to proceed from pure Malice againſt God and Men. But if we be only careleſs and heedleſs of what we do, tho' it be never ſo ill, and what others may do after us, it is at leaſt want of good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our ſelves, and want of that kindneſs and charity which we owe to our Brother, and draws upon us the guilt of thoſe ſins, which our Examples have been the Cauſes of. Like as we ſhould reckon that Man deviliſh and inhumane, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the ſevereſt Puniſhment, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf infected with the Plague, ſhould mingle himſelf with all Company, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly or careleſly breath out his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiferous ſteams upon all he met.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially are they concerned in this Admonition, whoſe Examples are of the moſt forcible and diffuſive Influence. Such who are moſt eminent and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, with whom compliance and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on brings great converſation, honour, and ſecular Advantages. The rich, the potent, the ingenious and learned, are like Stars of the firſt Magnitude, which draw all men's Eyes towards them; and we know how far it reacheth, and thanks be to God we know too how far it is prevented, when the Commands and Examples of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue come together from the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104491:28"/> Throne it ſelf; whoſe force we hope will in ſome time make its way through, and alter the Conſtitution of the whole Body, and drive out the Venom and Leproſie of Vice, which hath ſo long defiled and deformed it.</p>
            <p>After Hypocriſie, Enthuſiaſm, Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Impiety, and Contempt of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Superſtition and Idolatry ſucceſſively, we are in hopes to ſee a ſerious, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judicious Piety and Virtue; which ſhall not ſo much frighten as ſhame and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Men out of Vice. And if, together with this, Virtue and Sobriety were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, among others, the Diſtinguiſhing Condition, as they ought to be, of Honour and all other Secular Advantages, a great work would ſoon be in great meaſure done: For I think Vice never yet had ſo much eſteem as to have one ſmall Martyr for it. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are not to follow bad Examples when given. They can but tempt us, not force us; when the Text tells us, <hi>That evil Comunications corrupt good Manners;</hi> the meaning is, That they have always a natural tendency to it; but not that they always effect it. We may prevent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat their Influence by Precepts of Wiſdom, by Vigilancy and Reſolution. We may learn, receive and poſſeſs our Minds with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104491:29"/> right and juſt Opinions, with good and wholſome Inſtructions and Documents, with generous Paſſions and Purpoſes. We may ſoon attain to the Capacity of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Examples to be only Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not Reaſons of our Manners, to help our Imaginations, but not Arguments, to determine our Judgments. We need not be either ſurprized or overborn by them. We may, we ought to diſcover, examine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and compare them with others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject them if we pleaſe. If we find them fooliſh, mean, impious or bad, we are not to be drawn away by their Greatneſs, Number, Impunity, nay, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement too. For we need not be adviſed of a thing ſo common, that the Companions and Miniſters of Vice may be cheriſhed, honoured and rewarded; when Religion and Virtue are neglected and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as troubleſome, uneaſie and ill Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>Thus we may behave our ſelves, and not only ſecure our ſelves, but many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from the Infection and Contagion of fooliſh and wicked Examples. But it may be otherwiſe too, and we are always in very great danger of them. And truly, generally, as the ſtate of the World now goes, they reach us, and have their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104491:29"/> and pernicious effects more or leſs upon us; which ought not to diſmay us; but ſtill to encreaſe our Caution, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>Indeed we have had too long an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, and have felt its Influence ſo deep, and almoſt univerſal, that it is not like in a long time yet to be worked and worn out by the moſt operative and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Remedies that can be applied. We ſeem to have great need of a Confederacy here too, and all too weak and inſufficient, without the Conjunction of the Supream Power to head and conduct it, which we may promiſe our ſelves. Never can Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power be employed in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cauſe; in which they ſhall certainly have God on their ſide, his Aſſiſtance, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Bleſſing and Reward; the Hands and Hearts of the beſt Men, and the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of all, even of the very worſt.</p>
            <p>As for our particular, Let us liſt our ſelves under this Confederacy, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the number of Heaven's Forces againſt the Armies of Hell and Vice, and even by Multitude oppreſs them if we can: But if not that, at leaſt, let us by Courage and Conduct make good our Ground, and keep our ſelves entire; not only receiving the boldeſt Attacks of Vice and Folly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104491:30"/> but ſometimes charging through the moſt reſolute of their Troops. <hi>And may the God of all Power and Victory, who is not an unconcern'd Spectator of the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Prayers of his Faithfull Servants, multiply their Number, encreaſe their Zeal, Courage and Conſtancy, and in ſome meaſure grant them here preſent Succeſs:</hi> However, we are abundantly aſſured, that he will hereafter ſignally own their Service, and crown it with a glorious Reward.</p>

            <p>WHEN firſt Chriſtian Religion was introduced, and Societies which made Publick profeſſion of it were formed, there never appeared a greater contrariety of Manners in the World, than there was between the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and all the reſt of Mankind. The former were eminently pure, ſpiritually<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, humble, juſt, and in all inſtances charitable; the latter moſt impure, proud, malicious, envious, cruel.</p>
            <p>The Gentiles, except here and there a Philoſopher, or a good Natur'd-man, were as much corrupted in their manners and lives, as inhabiting together upon this Earth could well bear. Their very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104491:31"/> was the worſt part of their condition, teaching them Beaſtlineſs and Cruelty to ſuch exceſs, that it was neceſſary to be corrected by the light of Nature, and the ſupreme, civil Power; as the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> Some of the Fathers juſtly reproach them, that their Religion taught them nothing of Morality, as the Chriſtian Religion did: but only childiſh, ſuperſtitious, or beaſtly Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And the Holy Scripture in ſeveral places, gives us abundantly to underſtand, the moſt lamentable condition of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile World, when the Goſpel or Chriſtian Inſtitution came firſt among them; particularly the Epiſtles <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4.</note> to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Jews, though their Religion was good and wiſely inſtituted, in that place which it had of the whole Divine Oeconomy and Providence over all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from beginning to end; and although they had excellent Books of Morality, of which I reckon Piety and Devotion the principal part in their hands: yet both their inward manners and outward practice generally, were little better than that of the Heathens, except in one point of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104491:31"/>
            <p> They living every where promiſcuouſly with the Gentiles, and under their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſoon grew like them, retaining only what they could of the Rites of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſome true opinions concerning the Deity to diſtinguiſh them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth them with an univerſal Defection and Corruption in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 2. 3. and their own Writers are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes how wicked they were. And the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> particularly had a Tradition, that juſt before the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> Impudence in wickedneſs ſhould abound, as ſome think it will before his ſecond Coming.</p>
            <p>This was a deplorable State of humane Race; but conſidering the Ignorance and Darkneſs which had ſo long covered the face of the Earth; where they rarely heard or but ſuſpected any thing better, it was not ſo much to be wondered at. But ſtrange it was when they heard the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, or did but ſee the contrary manners and practiſers of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that they were not all of them ſtartled; and yet ſtranger that they ſhould wonder at the Chriſtians, that they would not live as they did. And yet ſo it was then with the Heathens towards the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and ſo it is ſtill with bad Chriſtians,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104491:32"/> little more ſuch than in Name, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the moſt Numerous towards the Good, who are in Heart and Life obedient to the Laws of Chriſt. And that is the Obſervation as briefly as may be to be treated of.</p>
            <p>Vicious and diſſolute Men wonder that all others are not like themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted of, but that they have their Reaſons for it, what-ever they be. And they are the ſame by which they uſe to juſtifie and excuſe themſelves and all others, who are drawn to compliance with naughty Manners, and corrupted by evil Examples.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be my buſineſs at this time to ſee what ſome of them are, and to give the ſtrongeſt of them its full Anſwer.</p>
            <p>We may conceive ſome of them to be theſe.</p>
            <p>They ſay then, that as the World ever did, and now goes, to be Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Pious and Virtuous is, (1.) To be Singular, and to call all men's Eyes, and Talk, and Cenſures towards us. (2.) It is to be Solitary, Melancholy and Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, when others are diverted, courted and crouded with good Company. (3.) 'Tis to be contemptible and ridiculous. (4.) To be revil'd and perſecuted. (5.) 'Tis to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104491:32"/> an impoſſible, or at leaſt an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly difficult, and conſequently painfull thing. We have not time to ſpeak any thing conſiderable to all theſe Excuſes: For the preſent we'll take only the three laſt, and of them put the two firſt together more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but the laſt of all, which ſeems the beſt they have, and is by experience found moſt to deter Men from the Reſolutions of undertaking a vertuous Life, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a final farewell to vicious Manners and Company, is that which we ſhall hear and anſwer more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In the firſt place then to abſtain from the evil Manners and Lives of the bad, to joyn our ſelves to and practiſe with the good; the firſt being the generality of Men of all ranks and conditions, will expoſe us to much contempt, hatred and ill Treatment. We ſhall meet with neither favour nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Such was the uſage of the Chriſtians by the Heathens. Here in the Text they are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſpeaking evil, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Chriſtians. No doubt their Tongues, and their Hearts, and their Actions went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; they reviled, deſpiſed, hated, and ill uſed the Chriſtians, becauſe they would not comply with their abominable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and Practices. And it is the ſame thing ſtill in general (though there may
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104491:33"/> be ſome difference in degrees, and ſome Circumſtances) between the bad and the good, even of the ſame external Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion. Of which ſome of the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in few words ſeem to be, The fooliſh and falſe Opinions of Libertines (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if great, who take licentiouſneſs to be the privilege and property of their rank) that religious and conſcientious Men are timorous, and mean ſpirited, becauſe they dare not venture upon ſome Actions and Courſes, which they fear not; when it truly proceeds from their Judgment, Choice, and a great Mind; or on the contrary they will have them to be proud and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, thinking themſelves wiſer than eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body elſe, and on purpoſe contradicting common practice; whereas 'tis true Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and good Underſtanding, to fear God and depart from evil. 'Tis Piety to God, Charity and Compaſſion to the World, prudent Care of their own greateſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. Finally, they think, that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Manners of good and vertuous Men reproach them firſt; theſe by their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of life which they take, in effect call them Fools, or perverſe, weak, or wilfull. Which indeed is true: but it is the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſignification of their Principles which they cannot help: nor are they willing if
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104491:33"/> they could, becauſe they hope it may at laſt prevail upon ſome of them to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and to do better. At leaſt they think themſelves obliged to appear in, and for the Cauſe of Religion and Vertue, and not any way to contribute to the danger of the few good, or the confirmation of the many bad.</p>
            <p>But let the Cauſes of this unjuſt uſage of the Religious and Conſcientious be what they will, 'tis confeſſed that the Matter of Fact is true; but it is denied to be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon, either for the compliance of the good, or for the wonder of the bad, that they do not.</p>
            <p>As if there were no better reaſon for Vertue, and living well, than the pleaſing of Men; not one in 1000 of which have any reaſon at all for what they are, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d do; but only humour, paſſion, appetite, and example of the moſt and worſt. 'Tis true, he that diſcreetly and conſcientiouſly will not go with a multitude to do evil, may be evil ſpoken of, and ill uſed by the blind, inconſiderate, or cowardly; but can never deſerve it.</p>
            <p>'Tis they, who are the fooliſh, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perverſe and wilfull in their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Folly; and therefore their Qualities to be deſpiſed, and their Perſons pitied.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104491:34"/>
            <p> Let men give me better reaſon than I have for what they do, and I'll follow and thank them too. But this contempt of thoſe, who have no other reaſon, but their confidence, number, and humour, or blind paſſions, and inclinations is to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and will never move a Man of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpirit or underſtanding, who knows what, and for what reaſons he ought to do any thing. And the truth is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for imitation of the many (great or ſmall) in evil Manners to avoid being neglected, contemned, deſpiſed, frowned upon, or hated, reacheth only the more mean and vulgar minds, whatever they appear; from which notwithſtanding, they ought to be ſecured by particularly ſhewing and minding them, of the folly and injuſtice of it, in reſpect of God, our Neighbour, and our ſelves; and that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to be made which is worſt, to be really an ill man, and to be ill-ſpoken of, or ill-uſed by ill men, through pride and ill-nature, or even by the better through miſtake. For we'll take but that one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our own true Intereſt, and a prudent care of our ſelves. Who would not take it for a Reproach, to be counted like a ſilly Sheep to drown for company, or prefer being wicked and miſerable, with a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104491:34"/> Multitude before being innocent and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py alone, leaſt they ſhould ſcoff or be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them for Cowardice, or breaking Company. Suppoſe nineteen of twenty ſhould in a Frolick draw their Blood, or drink Poyſon to the Ruin of Health, or endangering Life, doth any man think himſelf under the leaſt Temptation to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſuch folly and madneſs, leaſt he ſhould be taken for a Daſtard, or an ill Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
            <p>Theſe Similitudes are not impertinent, or improper, let men believe as they pleaſe. For wicked Courſes of Life continued in, are and will be, as ſurely the death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our Souls, and often of our Bodies and Eſtates altogether, as ſome Wounds and Potions are mortiferous to our Bodies only.</p>
            <p>Add to this the conſiderations of Piety to God, and Charity to Men. The good Man who reckons himſelf born for the Service of God, and to do good to others, as well as enjoy it himſelf, reaſons well when he thinks himſelf the more obliged to honour God, and to preſerve himſelf and others from the Infection of bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when their Number, Confidence, and Security is ſo great, as to wonder, and deſpiſe, and treat hardly all thoſe who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104491:35"/> are not like themſelves: the more the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and folly, and impiety of the World encreaſeth, he thinks himſelf the more bound to endeavour to leſſen it, by ſaving himſelf, at leaſt if he can do no more. 'Tis the moſt ſeaſonable and neceſſary then to be the beſt, when the World is the worſt, and men are generally running to their ruine. Such is the Apoſtolical Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to Chriſtians, <hi>to be harmleſs and blameleſs the Sons</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 15.</note> 
               <hi>of God in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nation, and to ſhine as lights in the World.</hi> Never more need of light, than in a groſs and general Darkneſs, nor of the Mounds and Banks of reſolute, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Examples, than when the Floods of vicious ones threaten to drown all. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, we muſt not allow or grant too much to this Plea and Excuſe, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to evil Examples, and bad Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>There are a great many wiſe and good Men (though too few) whoſe Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Favour and Aſſiſtance, we ſhall not fail of by our retreat and ſeparation from wicked Practices, though never ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and great, and then oft-times at leaſt, if our Non-conformity be as diſcreet and prudent, as it is ſincere and conſcientious,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104491:35"/> thoſe very Perſons who from the Teeth outward, reproach and ſlight us, will ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in their own thoughts eſteem, and commend us; or if at ſometimes, when upon the rant, and in the heat of paſſion, they may inwardly contemn and hate us too, yet at others in their ſober Moods, when they are moſt themſelves, they may be of another opinion.</p>
            <p>And I think it is not to be doubted, that the Text ſpeaks here only very generally; and that ſome even of the Gentiles, were ſtruck and awakened by the light, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the innocent, vertuous, ſpiritual and heavenly Converſations of the Chriſtians, and inwardly mov'd to eſteem and admire them. Nay after ſome time, ſome even of thoſe, who at firſt wondred at the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and Novelty of their Manners were ſo affected, though they did not yet leave their own. For that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by the way, that men may in ſome conſiderable Degree, approve, eſteem, and love that in others which they do not practiſe themſelves; the one coſting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the other much pains and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: and that therefore ſincere Piety and Vertue, have not ſo many and fierce Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as from appearance may be thought. Beſides, this excuſe hath no place, when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104491:36"/> the greatneſs of our Condition, and our advantageous Circumſtances may be ſuch, as to command Honour and Imitation of us; not to fear contempt or ill-uſage, for not imitating of others; when it is thought our part to give Examples, not to follow.—But as I have ſaid, It is the laſt excuſe of men for going along with the Crowd of the vicious; namely, the difficulty and painfulneſs of doing otherwiſe, that ſhall moſt enlarge this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>To follow a Multitude is always jolly and pleaſant: but when our Nature ſets us going too, it is little leſs than neceſſary, and the contrary impoſſible. Let us hear it at large.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They will then alledge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that Vertue and Sanctity to our Natures, ſuch as they are born, and ſuch as they are by long uſe and cuſtom now made, are in the higheſt degree difficult and laborious, and conſequently grievous and painfull, and next to impoſſible; but Vice is eaſie, and thence delightfull and pleaſant. And it is certain, that one of the moſt general, and ſure Cauſes of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and continuance of the Inclinations and Actions of humane Nature, is firſt Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and then Pleaſure. What is painfull will either be never attempted, or ſoon left off.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:104491:36"/>
            <p> To ſpeak more diſtinctly and properly: We acknowledge (ſay they) ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of an appetite to Vertue, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good; but we find an hundred others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more forcible and ſtrong.</p>
            <p>Now to exalt Vertue to an univerſal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and to preſerve it there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; to bring all other appetites and paſſions down to its ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo as to receive all their motions, their very being, end, and meaſures from its directions and commands, tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how it may be done? For the man void of all Honour and Love to God, nay an Hater of that moſt perfect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature, to be his devout Adorer and Imitator; for the little ſelfiſh Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to a point to become great, and widen it ſelf to his Countrey, Mankind, or even the Univerſe; for the malicious and ſowre Ill-nature to be ſweetned into Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for the proud and covetous to deſire and value no more of Honour, Power and Wealth, than what he may be able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to the Honour of God, his Sovereign, and the good of others his fellow Subjects, and for that very end; for the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and luxurious to ſcorn any bodily Pleaſures, or ſenſual Delights, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they are the Means and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104491:37"/> of Piety, Charity, and our own ſpiritual and eternal Good; any further than they are neceſſary or uſefull in this frail Life of Fleſh, to remove the Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, or to procure the helps of Vertue and Beneficence, of being and doing good. Thus to turn all the Motions, Inclinations; and Averſions of our Souls upſide down; <hi>To put off the old man,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 22, 24. Col. 3. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>which is corrupt according to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull Luſts</hi> (as the Scripture phraſeth it) <hi>and to put on the new man, which is created after God in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs:</hi> This, this is an undertaking moſt difficult, irkſome, tedious, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be ever performed; of which the ſmall number of thoſe, who but ſeem to do it, and the vaſt multitude of thoſe, that never think of it, is an evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And may we not well wonder at the firſt, who will adventure to turn head, and with ſore labour perpetually tugg againſt the Stream of Nature, and almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Example? may we not well excuſe thoſe, who ſwim down eaſily with ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Tide, or permit themſelves to be carried by it?</p>
            <p>This is the Summ of their laſt Plea (and I think the beſt they have) made
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104491:37"/> uſe of, by vicious and diſſolute Men, for their wonder at thoſe who will undertake to be better, and defence of thoſe who are as bad as themſelves. And to this we ſhall return, I hope, no inſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Reformation and Converſion from Vice to Vertue, from Sin to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, however it is effected, is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, needs no other Evidence than the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Examples of ſome, and the good ones of many. We confeſs that they are but few, comparatively: yet in various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and degrees more than bad Men are willing to allow; who induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly diminiſh them, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretend to believe, that there is hardly any in ſincerity and reality, but only for by-ends, and in outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But this is certainly falſe, and there are thoſe in the World, who after impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry and mature Deliberation of what is really true and good, (nor do they affect to be miſtaken, as wilfully vicious Men do) are convinced, that Vertue and Holineſs are the Perfections of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the only Source of Felicity of Life; which leaves not there, but intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſeth them with the moſt inward inclinations of their heart to it, and with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104491:38"/> the moſt ardent Aſpires to the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it their Nature can receive; and are ſo uneaſie under the Delays, Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and Oppoſitions they meet withall in this State, that they have oft-times much ado to ſecure their patience and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Behaviour to God Almighty. That againſt the pretended impoſſibility.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the great difficulty, pain; and pain we ſay, that it is not ſo great and frightfull as is uſually imagined. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We are not alone and helpleſs, far from it. There is, in this deſign and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of reſcuing our ſelves from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Slavery of that evil One, of blind Concupiſcence, contemptible Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and pernicious Luſts, and of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our juſt Obedience to God, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; there is, I ſay, one greater for us than all that are againſt us. The Grace of God is always ready to aſſiſt us. Nay, it is that which prevents us all in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other with good Counſels and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and cauſeth us to begin to look the right-way, to bethink our ſelves, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and not to play the children all our lives. This, if we cheriſh them, is more at hand ſtill; and if conſcious or ſuſpicious of our own weakneſs, we by earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers implore it, and by our Endeavours
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104491:38"/> concur with it, we ſhall not fail of ſuch a ſupply, which together with the Divine Providence diſpoſing the circumſtances of our lives, will render the Work much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier than was at firſt thought, and in ſome time delightfull. The Heathens themſelves were not ignorant of Divine Operations and Influence upon the Souls of Men; but it makes a conſiderable, and in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion a very auguſt part of the Doctrine of Revealed Religion. But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2) It is truly ſaid, that this difficulty of change from bad to good; of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from old but evil company and practice is principally at the beginning: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Things are indeed by the Divine Diſpoſition come to that paſs, that Vertue is to be ſweat for at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; the way to it at firſt is ſteep and rough, but when the Aſcent is mounted, there opens a ſpacious and ſmooth plain, which makes abundant recompence by its eaſe and delight. The ſuite, the progreſs of a virtuous and holy ſtate of Soul, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually exerciſing itſelf in Acts of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Righteouſneſs, and Sobriety, is full of pleaſures, the moſt ſincere, penetrating, conſtant and durable without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, remorſe, uncomfortable reflexions,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104491:39"/> ſuſpicions, or forebodings; nay multiplied by remembrances and hopes, which Vice never dared to pretend to.</p>
            <p>When the firſt brunt is over, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the mind ſet right, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their primitive, juſt, and natural order and conſtitution (for Virtue was firſt, Vice ſuper-induced) the great pain and difficulty then will be to commit a ſin, to do a fooliſh or ill thing, and continue in it; the eaſe, the pleaſure will be to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, condemn, and forſake it. Then the ſcales will be turned; not gratifying, obeying, ſubmitting to a malapert Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, an inſolent Luſt, a blind Paſſion; but the denial, command, ſuppreſſion, ſteady Government of all theſe by Religion and Reaſon, will be our glory, peace, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſatisfaction. They have been the Heathens too, who have ſaid ſuch things as theſe, of which ſure many of theſe very Wanderers could not be ignorant. <hi>Semita certè tranquillae per virtutem patet unica vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae.</hi> Much like that of the Divine Poet, <hi>Great peace have all they that keep thy Law.</hi> Now if it be thus (as moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is) bad Men are miſtaken in their plea, and much out in their reckoning, when they fright themſelves and others from a good and virtuous life, by the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104491:39"/> of it. For the tediouſneſs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an whole journey (ſuch as our life is) would be very childiſhly eſtimated by the firſt mile or two. And yet further, (3) I think it moſt certain (that we may not ſhrink at the firſt onſet) that the very firſt ſteps of change and converſion from bad manners to good, ſome of the firſt Acts of Repentance: (Such as are ſelf-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, indignation, ſorrow, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart for our moſt beloved ſins, firm reſolution utterly to forſake them, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with watchfulneſs and endeavour, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayers to God for forgiveneſs;) I ſay, even theſe have that ſecret pleaſure and ſatisfaction attending them, which out-weighs their trouble and difficulty.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, to be diſordered, aſhamed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and vexed at our wickedneſs and folly, to deſpiſe and reproach our ſelves, to pull from our hearts with a violent hand, that which hath had ſo long and kind an abode there, and ſtill makes great reſiſtance (for all cannot be done at once) this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly by it ſelf is no deſirable condition. But then it is blended with, or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed by a ſtrange ſecret joy and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, diffuſed through the intimate receſſes of the Spirit, from a ſenſe of the beginning, recovery, and reconvaleſcency of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104491:40"/> our Souls; of their reſtitution to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution at the firſt birth of Souls, of the aſſured reconciliation and favour of Almighty God our Heavenly Father, and finally of an hopeful, nay, ſafe condition to Eternity. So that take all together, a Man may with great aſſurance affirm, that there is, or may be more of joy than ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, more of eaſe and comfort than pain and ſorrow in Repentance, the ſowreſt diet a good Man taſts of; and this proportion is ſtill the greater, by how much the grief for ſin is more penetrating and preſſing, as being an evidence of its ſincerity. A Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent upon his knees ſipping in his briny Tears as they trickle, may take down a more delicious draught, than he, who quaffs off his full Bowls filled with the choiceſt Liquors. Sincere Repentance is like relief under a heavy burden, or the ſetting a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted limb, or the recovering of good appetite, clear health, and vigorous ſenſe by a bitter Potion or two. So is it, I ſay, even now found by experience as unhappy as our nature now is; and thoſe who are at preſent very hard to believe it, will never I am ſure employ their time better, than to make tryal of it themſelves.</p>
            <p>All this, I doubt not, was moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably verified in holy <hi>David,</hi> one of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104491:40"/> greateſt Souls that ever dwelt in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body, of which he himſelf be witneſs in ſeveral Pſalms; and it may be often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in other good Men after ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, who without any deſign never appear more eaſie and pleaſed in themſelves, and more innocently chearfull with others. Such then be the ſecond Anſwer to the plea of the extreme difficulty, pains and pain in converſion and reformation, in correcting this propenſion of depraved Nature; and quitting the moſt numerous evil examples: Namely, that we have the Grace of God to aſſiſt us, and render it more eaſie; that the difficulty is principally at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and firſt onſet; and yet that, even there the pleaſure and eaſe far out-weigh the pain and labour; and finally, that in the ſuite of a virtuous ſtate of Soul exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and actions, there are pleaſures ſincere, deep, conſtant, and durable, and but the ſample and commencement of infinitely greater ſtill. The difficulty and pain will lie on the ſide of Vice; and that it is moſt true, that a ſincere and generous good Man may find it more hard and vexatious to him to be brought to do an evil thing, than the moſt bold and accuſtomed ſinner to do a good one. Go we on further, and,</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104491:41"/>
            <p> 3. Suppoſe if we pleaſe that which is falſe, the utmoſt difficulty, labour, and ſuffering throughout the whole courſe of a virtuous and conſcientious life; nay, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we may loſe life itſelf for their ſake, and in their cauſe; have we never heard of any thing hereafter? or have we ſatisfied our ſelves with a demonſtration that we are not concern'd in that? Will there be no reward for the righteous, no vengeance for the wicked? had not theſe very <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> themſelves, their <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields for the juſt, their <hi>Tartara, Styx</hi> and <hi>Acheron,</hi> and various ſorts of never ending puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their wicked too? Had not the <hi>Jews,</hi> many of whom were infected with the Heathen Manners, their <hi>Paradiſe</hi> for the Holy, and their <hi>Gehinnom</hi> for ſinners; if they did not believe the Fable, they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly did believe the moral of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the happy ſtate of the good, and the miſerable one of the bad, and that everlaſting too, as might be ſhown.</p>
            <p>As for Chriſtians, do they not know, that in the day when God ſhall judge the World by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he will render to every Man according to his deeds; to thoſe who patiently continue in well-doing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and to thoſe who obey unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, indignation, wrath, tribulation,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104491:41"/> and anguiſh? Hath not Truth itſelf told them that there is a time when the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall go into everlaſting life, but the wicked into everlaſting puniſhment? we need not ſtand to reaſon upon ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions. The caſe is plain what we ought to do, if we have but common ſenſe and underſtanding. Is it not a moſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible and pitiable condition we are in, if we ſuffer our ſelves to periſh everlaſtingly, becauſe we will not take the pains of a few days to be ſaved? to fall into a ſtate of meanneſs and miſery, whence no redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, through mere lazineſs or cowardice; having not the heart to encounter ſome difficulty, or courage to bear ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pains and pain, though it were the pulling out of an Eye or cutting off an Hand? Oh! where is the wiſdom of ſuch, who eaſily ſwim down in a pleaſant ſtream, which runs into a dead Sea, or a lake of Fire and Brimſtone? Where is their reaſon, who forewarned, dance on merrily with a jolly croud in a ſmooth way, till at laſt they tumble altogether into the mouth of a <hi>Volcano,</hi> when they were an hundred times adviſed, and entreated to take a certain path; at its entrance, indeed more ſolitary, rugged, and a little toilſome (if you pleaſe:) But which in a ſhort time
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104491:42"/> would bring them into a place beyond all imagination delicious, furniſhed with the moſt agreeable and excellent company, eternally ſecure from any diſturbance from within or without? Whoſe part is it now to wonder? are the riotous, diſſolute, and vicious to wonder at the folly and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as they think) of the pious, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and well-governed; or theſe at the willfull madneſs or ſottiſhneſs of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? Theſe no doubt, if all be true that hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>But ſome who have the greateſt reaſon to fear, will not believe ſo great ſeverity (ſo they term it) of Almighty God to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though they are willing to believe his kindneſs and bounty to the good. Men can believe almoſt what they pleaſe, and that againſt the moſt univerſal Tradition, Reaſon, and Conſcience of Mankind. But they have ſome reaſon: what's that? Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cannot hurt God, and do but enjoy themſelves. Is this ſaid in earneſt? or is it only becauſe they will not openly own Infidelity? But,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) They would hurt God Almighty if they could, and every one elſe; were their power anſwerable to their will, God himſelf would not be ſafe or happy. Every knowing and willfull Sinner, who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104491:42"/> or complies not with God's moſt wiſe and beneficial Government of the World by his Laws and Decrees, by his Commands and Appointments, hath the Inſolence, and doth what he can, to make God and all the World beſides, the Miniſters of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal pleaſures and luſts, and is the Enemy of God, and all that he hath made. And I think ſuch an one deſerves the ſevereſt puniſhment, and ſo doth all humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment judge and act too. The very will and purpoſe alone is a tendency to ſuch miſchief; it is a partial and inchoative cauſe, and is accordingly to be uſed; of which further reaſons may be ſtill given. But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) According to this reaſoning God muſt not reward his faithful Servants who love him; for they can as little profit God as the rebellious and malicious hurt him. If God accept the will for the deed, and reward it too, why may he not puniſh the will for the deed likewiſe? And,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) I do not ſee, but that the Act of will is the only proper Act of a Man, and that all external effect is from God, when and in what meaſure he pleaſeth. So that in proper ſpeaking, a ſinner hurts no body; but wills to do it. He is indeed inwardly malicious, proud, careleſs of every one
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104491:43"/> but himſelf, or gratifying his own luſts; that theſe have any external effect more or leſs, comes from another hand.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he can hardly ſeem in earneſt, who asks why vicious Men ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſo ſeverely only for enjoying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Nevertheleſs, becauſe we do not know how childiſh, trifling, and fooliſh Vice, may indeed render ſome Men, even in things of the vaſteſt importance, we ſay that (to take the three capital and general ones, malice, pride, and ſenſuality, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, injuſtice, covetouſneſs, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred others, being only their kinds or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments) the malicious Man delights in miſchief and would do nothing elſe too, if God would permit or rather lend him his power for ſuch a purpoſe. The proud Man and the envious (which ſeems com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of pride and ill-nature) would have every one under his feet, and may affect ſuperiority in every thing to ſuch a degree, as to permit none to enjoy any good thing but himſelf, if his will and deſires were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by an equal power to execute them. The ſenſualiſt (who ſeems moſt intended in this excuſe) if he will enlarge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his carnal appetites and luſts, would command and force all that belongs to all Men to ſatisfie them, if he dared and could.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104491:43"/> Nor can he generally gratifie intemperance, luxury, and wantonneſs without Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Companions, whom he makes and keeps as bad as himſelf; and never without the miſchief of a bad example; and of all this were ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors examples, as notorious, as odious, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in the end.</p>
            <p>Beſides a Senſualiſt is unjuſt to God, to others, to himſelf; all have a right to the uſe of any power, which God hath endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any one withal, ſo far as it will go. All power is to do good to its utmoſt extent, like as every member of the body ('tis St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s excellent compariſon) were it endued with underſtanding, would be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do its utmoſt for the greateſt good of the whole; not to be in any degree uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or miſchievous. The Poſſeſſour hath only the privilege to judge of Perſons, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and Meaſures, and accordingly to diſtribute, God is the Maſter and Owner of all our faculties, abilities, enjoyments, we are but his Stewards. The Senſualiſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireth, oppreſſeth, or abuſeth thoſe powers and faculties, which God hath given him for his honour and ſervice, for his own and others, eſpecially ſpiritual and eternal good. He deprives himſelf of perfection, tranquility, happineſs, a thouſand of times
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104491:44"/> more than he enjoys; and if chaſtiſement and puniſhment be juſt for thoſe who will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully murder or maim their Bodies, (ſo it may be by ſome mark of Infamy) or, who will idle away their time and ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their labour and uſe is loſt to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and themſelves too, why not for thoſe who do the ſame to their Souls?</p>
            <p>The immediate reaſon of all reward and puniſhment ſeems to be the maintenance, encouragement, propagation, of any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, power, or action, which is good and beneficial, and the reſtraint, diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, oppreſſion of that which is evil and miſchievous, either privatively or poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſuch ſurely at leaſt is the willfull, neglect, or omiſſion, and conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of the uſe of that power any Man hath to ſerve God and do good withal; much more the abuſe and converſion of it to diſhonour and diſpleaſe God, to oppoſe and hinder his Service, and to do miſchief with it.</p>
            <p>The ſlothfull Servant was thrown into the ſame kind, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not the ſame degree of <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 51. <hi>and</hi> 25. 30.</note> puniſhment, with the evil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. And the evil Servant too was he, who eat and drank with the drunken, as well as he who ſmote his Fellow Servant,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104491:44"/> He that did but enjoy himſelf, (as the phraſe is) as well as he who abuſed others.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the Puniſhment of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinners, after this Life, is not their Amendment that we read in Scripture; but the manifeſtation of the Wiſdom, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, in the Government of the World, and for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Prevention in others. For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Saints ſhall be Spectators and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of the Righteous Judgment of God, by Jeſus Chriſt, in that great and terrible Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The beſt reaſon of the everlaſting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the miſerable State of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ſeems to be the continuance of the ſinfull State of their Souls: Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſpoſitions, and Inclinations, and Wills, being in no ſort changed for the better by their Sufferings. Which we need not wonder at, ſince we ſee here ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Examples, in whom afflictions and ſufferings in extremity alter nothing of their inward Manners: not the loſs of parts and endowments, not Ignominy, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Priſons and Gaols, not corporeal Diſeaſes, and grievous Tortures and Pains; nay, finally, not Death it ſelf, for heinous Crimes.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104491:45"/>
            <p> You may hear them bitterly complain of their misfortunes, pains, unhappineſs; but not a word of their ſins. You ſhall ſee them wriggle and turn a Thouſand ways for their Diverſion, Eaſe, and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but not to the humble Confeſſion of their Sins, tho' they know as well as the Damned are like to do, that they are the Cauſe of their Sufferings; not to ſincere Reſolution of Amendment, earneſt Prayers to an offended God, not only for Pardon, but for Purification of their Hearts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that admirable Pattern of that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 51.</p>
            <p>If it otherwiſe happen in this Life, as it doth ſometimes, it is to be attributed to the ſpecial Operations of the Grace of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Occaſions. Without which, even in this preſent State, to him who conſiders things, the habitual Change of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may well ſeem impoſſible againſt the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> how much more then in the State of the Damned hereafter.</p>
            <p>What ſufficient reaſon <hi>Origin</hi> had ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily to determine, that the hideous Sufferings of the Damned, would natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force them, as it were, to Repentance, (by which, I mean, an inward Charge of the very Inclinations of the Soul, to love God, that all perfect Nature, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104491:45"/> or the Sanctity and Purity of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, above all other things) I know not.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf, from whom it <note place="margin">Phaed.</note> is like, he had the firſt notice of this Doctrine, doth teach, that as ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men might be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, capable of being reſtor'd to a vertuous State of Soul, by their Sufferings in the miſerable State hereafter: So others there were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and conſequently, to continue there Eternally, and never to come out from that Infernal Priſon.</p>
            <p>But why <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould make ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the miſerable there, I know not, excluding any ſupernatural Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If Sufferings naturally in ſome men altered their Opinions, and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Soul, by bringing them to reflexion and conſideration firſt, why ſhould they not have that effect in all, ſooner or later, in ſome time or other?</p>
            <p>And for my part, I do not ſee how any man can hope for an End of Puniſhment there, till he can prove, that God will ſometime afford his effectual Grace, for his Converſion, and the Change of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and corrupt Nature. And when he can prove the one, I think, he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the other. For as God will not there any longer ſuffer the wicked, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104491:46"/> to be as well, or better treated, than the Righteous his affectionate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as they ſeem to be here in outward Reſpects: So will he never keep a good Man in ſuch a bad place and company.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome part of this Diſcourſe may ſeem too long a Diverſion; but a little ſpice of Scepticiſm or Infidelity from a ſculking Objection, is ſo apt to abate or defeat the force of all Arguments, and Perſuaſions to be good, that I was not unwilling to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, (for I am not the maker of it) and at the ſame time ſufficiently to ſatisfy it, as I hope I have done. Though more amply and particularly to prove many of theſe things, will require more time and words, than is meet to be ſpent in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And let this be then the third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, to the beſt Plea of the wonderer at the good, and the juſtifier of bad Men and Manners.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer in few words is this, That ſuppoſing the whole Courſe of a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and vertuous Life, to be very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and grievous, which is falſe; yet it is a folly and madneſs which deſerves the greateſt wonder and pity, for the avoiding of that, to loſe an everlaſting Happineſs, and to plunge our ſelves into an eternal Miſery, which is not Talk only, but Truth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104491:46"/> and Juſtice, if there be any God or Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the World.</p>
            <p>To a man of a comprehenſive Reaſon, Juſtice and Generoſity, may be added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and beyond all the reſt. A</p>
            <p>4. Anſwer, which I muſt not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon; but only in very few words, ſay. To pleaſe, ſerve, and honour God by love and obedience, to contribute what we can to the common Good and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by all vertuous Life and Actions (Vice is uſeleſs or miſchievous, a common Nuyſance) is certainly a Duty and an Obligation, which no Difficulty, Pains or Suffering in this Life, can diſcharge us from.</p>
            <p>I do not underſtand how all our Duty is derived from our own Intereſt, although, I know they are inſeparable. To ſerve and pleaſe God, and to do good to others, meerly for our own ſakes, and to refuſe to undergo any thing for theirs, when neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſeems neither ingenuous nor reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And I am ſure it ſeem'd ſo to that great Heathen, <hi>Tully.</hi> As if ſuch things, or rather nothings as we, were more to be conſider'd than the Infinite God, and all the World beſides; when we may as well weigh a ſingle <hi>Atome</hi> againſt the Univerſe. Nor ſeems there any difference between a good
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104491:47"/> and bad Man, in reſpect of their Will, but only of their Underſtanding, if both of them make themſelves their entire ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End. The one takes the right courſe to be happy, the other the Wrong: But this laſt is miſtaken only, and would have done as the firſt, if he had known better. And even the Man of Courage and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, would take it for a great Reproach to be told, that he fights only for a little Wages or Honour either, and would not venture upon a Wound or Death it ſelf, to ſave his Prince, and Countrey, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs an inſolent and malicious Enemy, who pleaſeth himſelf in the Deſtruction of all Mankind, to gratifie his boundleſs Luſts. Which with many other Inſtances is an Argument, that the Soul of Man at preſent, is not uncapable of ſo great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Quality. I am ſure our divine Religion hath taught us as much, both by Precept and Example, when it commands us to love God above all things, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as our ſelves. Nor do I ſee reaſon to find a Figure in the known Expreſſions of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> To ſuch a Greatneſs of Soul we ought to aſpire.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding we are to know, which may be proved even to a Demonſtration from the Nature of God, and of the Soul,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104491:47"/> that our Duty and Intereſt, our perfection of Nature and Happineſs of Life are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable, except for a Moment or two in this Life, for Exerciſe and Improvement of Vertue or other Ends, which vaniſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing compar'd with Eternal Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible that the wicked ſhould be happy or not miſerable, and that the vertuous and good ſhould be miſerable or not happy. As impoſſible as that there ſhould be no God at all: or that God ſhould not be infinitely powerfull, wiſe and good, and conſequently diſtributively juſt.</p>
            <p>And now, I have ſaid all I have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in Anſwer to the wonderers, and their beſt reaſon for vicious Manners, Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, Cuſtoms and Examples; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the general Heads of all that can be ſaid, and what I think cannot be anſwered again, by thoſe who will act like Men, and be governed by Truth and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But as for thoſe who diſclaim or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque their own moſt excellent Nature, and will abandon themſelves to blind and haughty Self-will, Humours, Luſts, and Paſſions; who will be like the Horſe or Mule, that wanteth underſtanding; I leave them to other Arts and Methods of Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to the Mercy of God Almighty,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104491:48"/> which we will not confine. All that can be done for them on our parts, is to pity and pray for them, as we do daily, when we ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, thy Will be done,</hi> That God may at laſt rule over, and in the Hearts of all the Sons of Men. He can when he pleaſeth work moſt effectually upon the Souls of the moſt ſenſleſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate Sinners; even upon thoſe who ſcorn all Inſtruction as a mean, and hate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as a troubleſome thing; even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who moſt fooliſhly take it for a Point of Wiſdom, and Greatneſs of Heart, to make a Mock at Sin; even upon thoſe finally, who with the Heathen Idolaters in the Text, think it ſtrange that all Men run not with them to the ſame Exceſs of Riot, ſpeaking Evil of them becauſe they will not.</p>

               <bibl>PSAL. XXXII. 5.</bibl>
               <q>I ſaid, I will confeſs my Tranſgreſſion unto the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Am a while to treat of a Duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, both revealed, and, as I think, natural, which perhaps paſſeth among the wiſe and brave of this World, for a weak and mean thing, and an effect of ſuperſtition rather than Religion: But to me it ſeems juſt contrary, ſo qualified and directed, as ſhall preſently be mentioned. Confeſſion of Sin to Almighty God, hath very evident Arguments of many excellent Qualities.</p>
            <p>For, is it not a ſign of a juſt Honour for God, and all his Laws made known, by Reaſon or Revelation? Is it not a Mark of a generous Love of the Truth, and that a Man will own his Faults and Follies, tho' to his preſent Diſadvantage, and that he is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104491:49"/> more aſhamed to commit a Sin than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it? Is it not a proof of great probity and ſtrength of mind, for a man not only to permit, but command his Conſcience (and others too if there be occaſion) to report to him all the Truth, and nothing but the Truth concerning himſelf; to ſet all his Faults and Infirmities before him, and not to conceal, excuſe, or juſtifie any, becauſe he is not willing to mend any, or hath no concern for the Health and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Nature? Are not theſe, and ſuch like Qualities, highly laudable? On the contrary, are not a vulgar Careleſneſs and Inſenſibility of our Manners and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vain, ſelf-conceit, arrogance, affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of appearing to ones ſelf, and others, ſomething worthy, rather than being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and above all, the contempt of the Word, and Commandments of Omnipotent Goodneſs, Wiſdom and Sanctity, by a weak, ignorant and ſinfull Creature; I ſay, are not theſe ſordid and truly contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            <p>Nor doth this confeſſion of ſin to the Supreme Deity ſeem to me leſs a part of natural Religion, than Prayers and Praiſes to him; though we have little mention of it among the Heathen Moraliſts.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:104491:49"/>
            <p> And as this is Truth in it ſelf, ſo we find that the greateſt Souls who have had the Knowledge of the true God, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways behaved themſelves with Truth and Decency towards him; acknowledged their Sins, thrown themſelves at his Feet, and humbly implored his Pardon and Grace. Nor was there ever recorded a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Example of this than <hi>David,</hi> as great a Prince as Saint.</p>
            <p>He wanted not ſurely that Courage which is ſo magnified and adored by the World, who when ſcarce got out of his Childhood, killed the Lion and the Bear; and, when a Stripling armed only with a Sling, ventured upon the prodigious Bulk of a Giant, a Man of War from his Youth, and laid him dead at his Feet, and returned to the Camp, lugging his Head, the Trophee of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; who from a ſimple Swain was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Alliance, and then Poſſeſſion of a Throne for his Proweſs and Wiſdom. And yet, lo this is the Man who cries out (Pſalm 51.) <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindneſs; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot put all my tranſgreſſions. Waſh me thoroughly from my ſin, for I acknowledge my tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and my ſin is ever before me. Againſt thee only have I ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. This is the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104491:50"/> man who, in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> proclaimeth the Bleſſedneſs of the Innocent, or the Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and telleth us, <hi>That while he kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence his bones waxed old through his roaring all the day long;</hi> This is he, finally, who in the Verſe of the Text, acknowledged his ſins unto God; who ſaid and did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <hi>That he would confeſs his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe it is, and ought to be a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious Duty enjoyned, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in our publick and private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Worſhip, it ought alſo, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to be well underſtood, prudently directed, and ſhewn to be moſt agreeable to natural Reaſon and Juſtice, as well as expreſly commanded and conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by good Men in the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we ſhall chuſe out three things for the Heads of our Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Nature and Parts of it: <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Rules for it: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Reaſons of it.</p>
            <p>1. And very briefly, in a more ſolemn and deliberate Confeſſion of Sin, eſpecially (and it is beſt to take into its ſignification more than one ſingle Act) three <note place="margin">Three Parts.</note> parts may be obſerved, and that in this Order.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:104491:50"/> 1. Self-accuſation: The Penitent having firſt enquired into his paſt Temper and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, conſulted his Conſcience concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Duty, and obſerved his Aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Rules of it: He proceeds as a Perſon different from himſelf, to accuſe and bring an Endictment againſt himſelf, and here he acts like a Plaintiff.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Follows an ingenuous and free Acknowledgment of the Truth, of what with the greateſt Impartiality he judgeth to have been bad in him, or ill done by him. Neither by Superſtition or Timidity vainly frighting, nor by Boldneſs or Partiality favouring himſelf. Here he acts the part of a guilty Defendant, and an upright Witneſs againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He pronounceth himſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deſerving of the Puniſhment, which God hath threatned for the Tranſgreſſion of his juſt Laws. And ſo he leaves himſelf to God, whether he will execute the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and puniſh him as he deſerves, or elſe be pleaſed upon his humble Confeſſion, and other parts of a compleat Repentance, to ſhew him mercy, reprieve and forgive him.</p>
            <p>Thus the true Penitent in this part of Repentance termed Confeſſion, acts as a Proſecutor, guilty Defendant and Witneſs, and an inferior Judge.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:104491:51"/>
            <p> In ſuch manner may be, in ſhort, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conceived the Nature and Parts of Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> The Rules follow. Some of which may be theſe;</p>
            <p>1. Let our Confeſſion be made with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Truth. We are at no time and with no Perſon to ſay, that which is not true: Leaſt of all, when we addreſs our ſelves to God. This fault can only be on one ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> by confeſſing thoſe things to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in us, which are not ſo, or to deſerve a greater Puniſhment than they truly do. For if we falſly think any thing really ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in us, not to be ſo, we do not confeſs that at all. The number and evil Deſerts of our Sins, are truly great enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; we need not to multiply or magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them in our Confeſſion by imagination and paſſion. As thoſe (for example) have always ſeemed to me to do, who in their Prayers acknowledge all their Actions, before their Converſion to be ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> before Grace was generally the ruling Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in their Hearts, or their lives were governed by their Conſciences. For a bad man generally ſpeaking, may now and then drop a good Action.</p>
            <p>Nay there are thoſe who have been ſo humble (which is excellent when it ſpeaks
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104491:51"/> truth, and not deſpiſable even when it is miſtaken, if ſincere) in their Confeſſion, as to ſay, That all the very beſt Actions of the beſt Men, after their Converſion are ſins too, but pardoned in Chriſt, which I do not well underſtand.</p>
            <p>Defective indeed they may be (and ſo is the moſt perfect love to God in the higheſt Angel; for no Creature can ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and love him in that degree which he deſerves) defective I ſay they muſt needs be, but not ſins. He who loves God with all his might, ſtrength, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as I doubt not hath been done often by pious Souls, ſurely ſins not, nor need ask any pardon for it, though he may juſtly acknowledge, that the greateſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction our hearts are capable of to him, are infinitely below the infinite Excellency of his Nature. The Confeſſion of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of a more than Jewiſh Obſervation of the Sabbath, in ſome men's Phraſe is upon this account blameable: but ſuch an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lord's Day, and other Feſtivals, as is preſcribed by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in one of their pious and grave Canons, is moſt agreeable to Chriſtian Piety and Prudence, and the general wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglect of it, more than ſavours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs. There are other ſtrange things
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104491:52"/> too, which in the depth of a ſeeming or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken humility have been uttered, eſpecially in ſome men's <hi>ex tempore</hi> Confeſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out countenance from Scripture rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and ſhocking the common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind. Numerous alſo are the Inſtances of this Errour among the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> who out of ignorance or deſign, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably, oft-times rack and vex men's Conſciences. But theſe things, need not to be too ſubtilly ſearched into. It is too much, that the beſt of us have too many, and too great faults to confeſs to Almighty God.</p>
            <p>The moſt uſual Cauſes of this Fault in confeſſion is, ſuch a degree of Self-revenge, Indignation, and Contempt againſt our ſelves, as to cauſe us to forget Truth and Juſtice to our ſelves, as they would ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily be the Cauſes of falſe Judgment on the worſt ſide againſt others, whom we are apt in ſuch Fits to accuſe of much more than they are guilty of. But of this Cauſe (though ſurely it be a fault) I am almoſt tempted to wiſh we could ſee more.</p>
            <p>But there is a ſecond Cauſe very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and that is a Deſign to flatter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</p>
            <p>It is not impoſſible but, that ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflection may conceit, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104491:52"/> they do to God, by confeſſing all, and more than all the ſins they are guilty of, may procure a Connivance for ſome ſins, though they never forſake them. It is enough, or very well to load themſelves with the heavieſt Accuſation, though they do not, or perhaps think they cannot grow better. Much like a great Debtor, who will readily own greater Summs than he really owes, if for that his Creditor will permit him to run further into his Debt, and not be angry.</p>
            <p>But the moſt frequent Cauſe of this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage is Superſtition, <hi>i. e.</hi> a groundleſs Timidity, by reaſon of miſtake in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Degrees of Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a thing of bad conſequence; when our Judgments are deceived, and our Affections abuſed; we may ſwallow that which is truly wicked, and greatly miſchievous, and be frighted at that which is really ſo far from being evil, that it may be good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Let our confeſſion therefore of ſin be truly informed and well adviſed: Which is the firſt Direction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> The ſecond is to confeſs our ſins moſt impartially. As we muſt not on the one ſide make or magnifie our Sins through Self-revenge, Flattery of Almighty God, Superſtition or Timidity: So we muſt on
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104491:53"/> the other hand take great care, that we do not excuſe, connive at, or extenuate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Such are our moſt profitable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull Sins; Thoſe which by corrupt Nature, or evil Cuſtom and Practice are deepeſt in our Hearts, and therefore moſt difficult and painfull to forſake: We muſt be in all ſincerity moſt willing to ſee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and amend what is truly faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our ſelves, and what is moſt ſo.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of a true hearted Chriſtian is to be better, and his hearty deſire is to reform univerſally, and in order to that, he muſt know what is really amiſs, and out of order. Like the wounded or ſick Man, who longs for his Cure and Health. He is not willing to conceal or forget any of his Ailments from himſelf, or his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. So far from that, that he beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Phyſician's care, as well as uſeth his own obſervation to diſcover all, leaſt through ignorance or neglect, ſomething may prove fatal to him.</p>
            <p>And what a fooliſh thing is it to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, or ſlubber over ſome ſweet, ſome darling Sins we are loth to leave, when we are upon our knees before God? He needs not our confeſſion for his informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſeeth the moſt ſecret and dark Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our Hearts, and knows full well
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104491:53"/> whether we hide any thing there or no. He obſerves whether we deal truly or hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically with him, and if he find the laſt, will reject us and our confeſſion too. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low we that great Example <hi>David. Cleanſe me from my ſecret ſins</hi> (Pſalm 19. 33.) prays that holy Man; and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſs in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting. He that thus prayed for the diſcovery of all his ſins without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, no doubt in his Confeſſion ſpared none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> A third Rule of our Confeſſion is, that it be performed ſeriouſly and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. The confeſſion here meant, is not uttering a few words with our Mouths, though never ſo good: but it is in the mind and ſpirit, though we ſhould not ſpeak a ſyllable. Nor is it to be ſlight and careleſs, as if it were a thing of no great moment, whether it were true or no, and we indifferent whether it were done at all. No! It is at the ſame time to be expreſly aſſented to by our Judgment, owned by our Conſciences, and thence paſs further into our affections. We are to be really troubled, aſhamed, diſordered and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the mention and remembrance of our ſins, according to the various Degrees and Aggravations. We are to be affected
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104491:54"/> with them in our Devotion, when our own Conſcience only can accuſe us, as if men of Gravity and Authority ſhould openly and publickly charge us. Nay (ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the difference which the hopes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don here may make) as if God himſelf inſtead of our Conſciences, was judging of us. And do we think at that terrible Day, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear with all the Enſigns of Juſtice and Majeſty, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments in his hands, we ſhall be looking another way? Shall we then ſtand unconcern'd, and confeſs our ſins in ſuch a manner, as if neither God nor our ſelves need take any notice of it. No, then with ſinking Hearts, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Knees, we ſhall ſee, believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that we are miſerable Sinners indeed. And yet all in vain, becauſe it proceeds only from the Terrour of the Sentence and Puniſhment juſt ready to be executed, not from the hatred of ſin, from the dread of the Judge; not from the love of him, or hatred of our Crimes. But now in this Day of Grace, our paſſionate Confeſſion and Cries from a truly penitent (that is changed) Heart to the Judge of all the World, that indeed we have preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ungratefully offended againſt his holy Laws, and that he would have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104491:54"/> mercy upon us miſerable offenders, ſhall through Heav'ns Goodneſs find a gracious Audience and Acceptance. Of ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and in ſuch manner ſhould be our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in the third place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> Our confeſſion ought to be ſuitable and proportionable. I mean our confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is to be proportionable to our ſins. Thus we ought between God and our own ſelves, moſt frequently and paſſionately to confeſs thoſe ſins which are in themſelves really the greateſt, and which we moſt frequently and deliberately commit. To be always with great vehemency, filling our Prayers with ſmaller Faults (though none are to be ſlighted and indulged, for ſmall ſins known, weaken conſcience and make way for greater) but more rarely or faintly to mention thoſe ſins, which are truly more provoking, is to offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Rule.</p>
            <p>Thus to confeſs impertinent and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Thoughts in Religious Duties, vain uſe of God's Name (though theſe things are by no means to be allowed or negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) but never to ſay any thing of Pride, Covetouſneſs, Injuſtice, Fraud, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Malice, or the like, or ſo coldly as if we ſcarce thought them any ſins; I ſay, this is to perform this Duty with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104491:55"/> if not Hypocriſie. For it is a ſhrewd ſign we can be very favourable to ſin, when it is agreeable or profitable, and therefore painfull to ſubdue and mortifie it. When we are clamorous againſt the ſins we get little by, or which coſt us little of expence, or pains to forſake: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſilent or ſoft; it is very ſuſpicious that there is not in us that hearty Zeal againſt ſin, which we would ſeem to be poſſeſſed withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> And <hi>laſtly,</hi> Our confeſſion will be the more commendable if it be voluntary, and from pious Motions in our heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by our judgments, when we freely open and diſcloſe our Souls to God, and earneſtly deſire witneſs, and judge God and our Conſciences to inform and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us of our Faults. As may be more eſpecially done at thoſe times which are ſet a-part for a longer and more deliberate performance of this Religious Duty.</p>
            <p>This is better ſurely than when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is thruſt upon us by a perſecuting guilty Conſcience, which we fly from as much as we can; or when it is extorted from us by the urging Interrogatories, or undeniable Proofs of our Friends or Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and then uttered with coldneſs and indifferency.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:104491:55"/>
            <p> Such are ſome of the Directions or Rules for our Confeſſion, which was the ſecond general Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> The third is ſome good for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent performance of this Duty of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are many.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By a ſerious affectionate and impartial Confeſſion of our ſins, we give God and his Laws their juſt Honour. At the ſame time we acknowledge and bewail our evil doings, in ſinning againſt God and tranſgreſſing his Laws, we proclaim the Righteouſneſs of both; nay the Juſtice of our Puniſhment which God hath, or may inflict upon us. When we accuſe, confeſs, condemn our ſelves, we juſtifie God in his Nature, Commands and Dealings towards us, when we ſeriouſly cry guilty, confeſs what we have done and deſerve, we at the ſame time declare that God's Nature is holy, his Precepts right, and all his Dealings with his Creatures juſt and unblameable. Like that great Example of Penitents, Pſalm 51. <hi>Againſt thee only have I ſinned and done this evil in thy ſight, that thou may'ſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:104491:56"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>2ly,</hi> This confeſſion of ſin is very edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to others, both good and bad, when it is performed publickly or with others, and owned our Duty in ſecret too. We hereby do ſomewhat conſiderable towards the Confirmation of the good, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the bad. The miſchief we have been the Authors of by our naughty Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we undo again in part by a free and ſerious Confeſſion; we thereby tell the World it was not our diſcretion, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to have lived, and done as we have done formerly. No! 'twas our folly and ſhame. We call now to them not to follow us, or if they have adventured after us, to retreat preſently. If they have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated us in ſinning, they would do it now in confeſſing, and condemning themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> This confeſſion of ſin is very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to good Men; nay, I may ſay, generally to bad Men too, who have ſome kindneſs and good liking for Vertue and Piety: but are ſo entangled and captivated in vicious Courſes, that they cannot find in their heart to take the pains to leave them. The converſion of a ſinner, of which free and humble Confeſſion is a fair ſtep and a great mark, is certainly the joy of Angels and Saints. Nothing more melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the hearty and unaflected Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104491:56"/> of a Penitent ſinner. It is a ſign of ſo many amiable Qualities, (as ſincere Piety, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> that a good Man cannot obſerve it without joy, and even a bad Man without ſome motion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. It is a more than ordinary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to hear a pious Soul ſighing out his confeſſion of his ſins, and deſires of grace, and pardon before God, when he thinks no body hears, or is regardleſs whether they do or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> This confeſſion of ſin is a very comfortable Duty to us. What calmneſs, eaſe, and ſecret comfort is diffuſed through the Soul of a devout Man, after he hath opened and disburthened himſelf by a ſincere and humble Confeſſion to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God? His conſcience ſoftly tells him, that he hath not in vain diſcloſed his heart; that he hath not confeſſed his faults to the deaf Ear of too rigid a Maſter, or ſevere Father; that God as great, and as high as he is, regards the Soul in ſuch a poſture with great kindneſs and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that now the offender may ſafely put himſelf into his hands. If in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion we are conſcious to our ſelves, of no Hypocriſie or Formality, it creates an humble confidence in God, with a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation and ſubmiſſion of our ſelves to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104491:57"/> him, notwithſtanding our former ſins, and contracted guilt. Nor is this confidence vain. For ſo far as our confeſſion is a ſign and exerciſe of real Goodneſs and Piety in us, it doth render us more capable of his Favour, and truly acceptable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> Confeſſion of our ſins, ſuch as I have directed, is a Duty of Devotion of great benefit to us, and that many ways. As,</p>
            <p>1. It is a certain and notable means for preſerving us in that Degree of Holineſs and Goodneſs we may have attained to, and of making further progreſs therein conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
            <p>For as it brings to remembrance our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer known ſins (nor are we only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs new ſins, but old ones, and the ſame very often, eſpecially if more heinous, nor even to forget them to our lives end) ſo it diſcovers to us many before unknown. Before eſpecially a more deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, we are to reflect upon, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves carefully, and that will hardly be done without ſome further knowledge and diſcovery of our faults, and (which is of great uſe) of their tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and occaſions. And even in the times themſelves of our devout Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, uſually the temper of our minds is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104491:57"/> ſuch, that ſome ſins then may firſt appear, which before we had never obſerved or ſuſpected. Now all this is neceſſary for our amendment, and the prevention of the like again. For how ſhall we avoid that, which we never knew or have forgot. Add to this that every ſerious and hearty (not cuſtomary) Confeſſion, impreſſeth upon us ſome more diſlike and averſion from the ſins confeſſed. Inſomuch, that by the frequent practice of it, we may at laſt become utterly aſhamed to confeſs our ſins ſo often, but not to forſake them; to ſin on in a round, perpetually committing and confeſſing the ſame ſins by turns. Our conſciences will be apt ſo to reproach, that we ſhall leave off either to commit or confeſs. Thus as an hearty and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained Confeſſion is a ſign and effect of an ingenuous and generous Diſlike and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, ſo doth it confirm, heighten and increaſe it.</p>
            <p>2. Another benefit and advantage of this Religious Duty, is a right Underſtanding, a true and juſt Opinion of our ſelves; to know what is bad and defective in our ſelves, as well as what is good and uſefull. This is one principal Branch of that moſt excellent Grace <hi>humility,</hi> which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many other. The great Errour of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104491:58"/> World is on that hand, to be arrogant and preſumptuous. Fooliſh Self-love renders us wilfully blind, ſo as to ſee no faults, ſpy no defects, obſerve no ſins in our ſelves. We deny all, or excuſe all, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie all.</p>
            <p>We all know the Behaviours of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, and the Publican in their Devotion <hi>(Luke</hi> 18. 9.) They both went up into the Temple to pray. The Phariſees Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was ſo far from any confeſſion, that it was all boaſting <hi>God, I thank thee that I am not as other men,</hi> &amp;c. The Publicans contrary, was all Confeſſion, Shame, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, begging for Mercy. He ſtands a far off with a dejected Countenance: He with a revengefull hand beats his Breaſt, and ſighs out, <hi>O Lord, be mercifull to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Our Saviour tells us what was the effect. <hi>I tell you this man went down ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtified than the other.</hi> As the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees Self-conceit and Arrogance, made him pray in ſuch a manner as he did, ſo his Prayer made him more arrogant ſtill: It could not but increaſe his preſumptuous Opinion of himſelf, to reckon up, and that before God himſelf, all his Religious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Actions without taking notice of but one ſmall fault, and to have compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf with one ſo deſpicable in his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104491:58"/> Eyes, as the poor Publican. It is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe, he went away bigger and ſtatelier from his Prayers, than he came to them. On the contrary, as the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can's Behaviour, Poſture and Prayer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, no doubt, from a due Senſe of his ſin and guilt, and conſequent humility: So did it likewiſe diſmiſs and ſend him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a greater Degree of it. He ſaw that before in himſelf, which made him cry out with ſhame and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, <hi>Lord, be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And doubtleſs he ſaw it yet more, and with deeper impreſſion upon his heart, for having made his ſhort but moſt paſſionate Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>4. This confeſſion of ſin makes us leſs cenſorious and contemptuous of others, more backward to publiſh their Faults or to inſult over them. We ſhall not be ſo ready to cenſure, talk of, deſpiſe others, when we are accuſtomed to look upon, and juſtly and humbly to acknowledge what is as bad or worſe, at leaſt bad enough in our ſelves. We are not ſo forward to reproach others, when we permit our own Conſciences to reproach our ſelves. We are loth to condemn, at leaſt to treat others with Wrath and Contempt; when if we
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104491:59"/> are impartial, we ſee too much cauſe to do the like by our ſelves. No men ſo ready to proclaim and aggravate other men's Faults, as thoſe who take the leaſt notice of their own. He who knows his own defects and miſcarriages as he pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties himſelf, ſo is he apt to do to others. Moſt men eſteem and deſpiſe others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, or as thy judge them ſuperior or inferior to themſelves in worthy, and deſerving Qualities and Performances. We take the Meaſures of others from our ſelves. Now he that obſerves moſt Infirmities and Faults in himſelf, will think himſelf leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or more under Men, than he who though ignorance or ſelf-conceit, ſees no blemiſh nor blame in himſelf.</p>
            <p>The former often deſpiſeth himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively with others; the latter fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſeth every one beſides himſelf. In the Example juſt now alledged how haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily doth the Phariſee hold up his Head, and with what Contempt doth he throw his Eye upon the Publican? <hi>This Publican,</hi> ſaith he: But we hear no ſuch Language from the Publican, who in truth had more reaſon to have derided the Ignorant and Hypocritical Phariſee.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104491:59"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>5ly,</hi> And <hi>laſtly,</hi> This confeſſion makes us more ſenſible of the Divine goodneſs, and diſpoſeth us to greater Gratitude and Love to God. The Divine goodneſs may well be our wonder. That the infinite Majeſty ſo provoked, hath not yet made us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Examples of his Juſtice and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; Nay, that he hath continued to us Life, Health, Strength, Plenty, Power, and the like Favours, which we ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Wretches have diſhonoured him with. His lenity and long ſuffering cannot but be admired by us, when we conſider that we have grown wanton and proud againſt him by his own benefits; and his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Goodneſs which ſhould have highly obliged us, hath made us careleſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, as if we now wanted him no more, and could ſtand upon our own Legs. But that which may juſtly increaſe our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, that after all this upon our humble confeſſion and actual Change of our Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards him, he is ready to forgive our greateſt Crimes, and to blot out all our Tranſgreſſions. So great is his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he is more ready to give us his pardon upon ſuch a Repentance, than we are to ask it, or by Repentance to render our ſelves capable of it; as if he courted our Friendſhip, and ſtood in need of our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104491:60"/> Reconciliation. Finally, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet more which exceeds wonder, and that is, that God ſhould be pleaſed ſo kindly to accept our late Repentance and Obedience, as to take occaſion from thence to beſtow upon us, no leſs than Eternal life. Now the ſerious and deliberate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our ſins, giving us a neceſſary occaſion to obſerve, and conſider all this; ſo certainly the Truth; cannot but deeply affect us with Gratitude and Love, to the Authour of ſuch unparallell'd Goodneſs and Love, expreſſing it ſelf by all ways poſſible, our Words, Services, whole Lives. Of ſo great and much greater ſpiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and profit, is a true, ſincere, ſerious, affectionate and free Confeſſion of our ſins to Almighty God. Which was the fifth Reaſon for the performance, and frequent Exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>And now, if we put all theſe Arguments together; the juſt Honour we owe to God and his Laws, the Edification and Pleaſure of others, our own ſpiritual Comfort and great Benefit, one would think they ſhould be ſufficient to reaſonable Men, guided in their opinion and actions by good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though we had no Commands from revealed Religion, not only to ſecure this Duty of Religion and Piety from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104491:60"/> or neglect: but eſpecially to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to their frequent and ſerious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice from the higheſt to the loweſt.</p>
            <p>For no mortal ſo high, whom it doth not exceedingly become, and perhaps bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the meaneſt. For excellent and great Qualities ſit beſt upon the greateſt, are moſt amiable in them, and moſt juſtly expected from them. And true Religion, the right Knowledge, reaſonable Worſhip, and Reſemblance, and Imitation of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being, and the Univerſal Parent, is the utmoſt Perfection and Attainment of humane Nature. Nor is there any in this Life ſo holy and innocent (take all our Lives together) who have not great cauſe for, and abundant need of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin.</p>
            <p>Thrones and Shrines, Crowns and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Soveraigns and Saints are with all juſt Humility to lie at the Foot-ſtool of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and moſt mercifull Father of his Creatures; we may altogether ſend up with one Heart and Voice, our common Cries of Confeſſion of Guilt, and Petition for Pardon, without fear of offending againſt the Dignity of our Condition, or Sanctity of our Profeſſion. None too great, none too good, to ſay with this great and good Prince;</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:104491:61"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>I acknowledge my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I ſaid I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my tranſgreſſion to the Lord, that he might forgive the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For a concluſion of this Diſcourſe, it may not be amiſs to pick out of it, and put together a brief Repreſentation of a true penitent Confeſſour, in ſome ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as follows.</p>
            <p>The ſincere and deliberate Penitent then is no negligent Perſon of himſelf, to let all things go at random, but is deſirous to bring things to a Trial, and to keep them in order in the Affairs of his Soul; nor is he ſlothfull or afraid to take notice of, and bring an Indictment againſt the Offender, though it be himſelf, when he thinks he hath been guilty, he will bring his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and let him anſwer for himſelf as well as he can. Nor doth he after this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to withdraw himſelf, not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his Action or Indictment, but to ſculk, lie hid, or have the buſineſs paſſed over: nor doth he when his carriage comes to be canvaſſed, alledge Pretences, make frivolous Apologies, ſhift and turn himſelf any way to excuſe and defend himſelf, or to abate and extenuate what he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. No: but he willingly makes his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104491:61"/> deſires nothing more than that the Truth may be known, and all that can be ſaid againſt him may be produced; that either he may where he juſtly can vindicate, or where he cannot condemn himſelf, were he is convinc'd of his Faults or Crimes, though never ſo heinous, he owns it, he cries guilty to God; ſaying, O Lord! I have indeed tranſgreſſed thy Commandments, I have done fooliſhly, I have been wicked, ungratefull, wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or careleſs, or preſumptuous; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it; I am perfectly aſhamed of my ſelf, I deſpiſe and abhor my ſelf; what ſhall I ſay unto thee, O thou great Maker, and Preſerver, and Benefactor of Men? I am obnoxious to thy greateſt Severity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, I deſerve to be puniſhed as thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Wiſdom thinketh moſt fit, I ſubmit my ſelf to thy Sentence, and receive and own it, whatſoever it ſhall be as the moſt juſt. But I hope that Juſtice may be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and allayed with Mercy, and that that Goodneſs which hath ſome way thus far led me to true Repentance, will go on ſo far to compleat it in me, as to render me capable of thy pardon and forgiveneſs. Nor is this Confeſſion forced from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Penitent, nor wrung out of him, nor thruſt upon him by his perſecuting
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104491:62"/> conſcience, which he flies as much as he can, nor extorted by the urging Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of his Friends or Enemies, with a great coldneſs and unwillingneſs. No, it is the moſt free and voluntary; he himſelf diſcloſeth and openeth all his Heart, and whatever he knows by himſelf, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſires both witneſs and judge too, to produce all his faults, and to tell him what he may be ignorant of, or hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. He is not willing to connive at any in himſelf, though never ſo criminal and ſhamefull, nor doth he deſire any to conceal them from him; he hath no dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling which he would not look upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not leave; or wink hard, becauſe he would not ſee it, or believe it to be no ſin, or ſo ſmall, that it deſerves not the trouble of any notice or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment. He drags out his moſt beloved, and his moſt juſtly ſuſpected ſins, and is not aſhamed to betray them, which he hath ſo perniciouſly hugged, and which have and would betray him by their Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Inſinuations and Charms to his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruin and Deſtruction. He prudently hath his Eye there where there is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger, and his greateſt, moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and moſt frequent Sins he will bring to the light, and ſo often till he makes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104491:62"/> the ſins themſelves to bluſh, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wonders at his own blindneſs and ſtupidity. 'Tis not a few words only that this man mumbles over, or a Repetition of any Form, as it were of Recantation with his Lips, when he is inſenſible, or perhaps laughs at it in his heart; no, it is within in his Soul: judgment and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and affections; all within him is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed and moved. He is no Hypocrite or Actor of a part, but oft-times appears rather on the other hand to have no ſuch thing, or to be of no ſuch temper when he is. None can tell perhaps whether he hath been in his Cloſet, or what he hath been doing there. Nevertheleſs he doth not refuſe if there be juſt occaſion (as in publick Devotion) to let all the World know, both by his words and carriage, what he thinks of himſelf, generouſly to juſtifie God and his moſt righteous Laws and Diſpenſations; but to accuſe, reproach and condemn himſelf. To adviſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh all men, that they beware of what he ſeeth his Folly in, and not to imitate his paſt bad Example. He is willing that good men ſhould underſtand, they have one come over to their party, and that bad men ſhould follow him. He is very glad to pleaſe good men with ſuch a ſight,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104491:63"/> nad even to add to the Joy of Angels. He ſoon ſpies the great benefits of this devout Exerciſe, and is very ſenſible of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and comfort of it. He now diſcovers more pravity, diſorder, and ſin, and more aggravations of them than he did, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently according to his earneſt deſire, can better prevent or amend them: he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands himſelf infinitely better than he did, and ſees great reaſon for humility, charity, pity and compaſſion to offenders; but not for an indifferency and neglect of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt way he can uſe to reform them. As he is grave and ſerious, and hath a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indifferent and mean, and ſometimes contemptuous opinion of himſelf; ſo is he for that very reaſon again cheerfull and gay, for that nothing is more ſo, than innocence or repentance. He makes his addreſs to God Almighty as with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and modeſty, ſo with great good hopes for ſucceſs in his requeſts, or for that which is better. He makes uſe of God upon all occaſions, and in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, as his refuge, his ſhelter, his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, his ſupply, his patron, protectour, benefactour; nay, his Father; caſting all his cares upon him with moderate indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and endeavour, but without ſolicitude and vexation.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:104491:63"/>
            <p> In fine, Though he have grievouſly and unworthily for the time paſt offended and diſpleaſed God, yet he is not afraid of him, but aſſured of his pardon, love and favour for Chriſt's Sake, becauſe he is well aſſured of his Repentance; and becauſe that God cannot lye, who hath ſaid, <hi>That he that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall find mercy.</hi>

            <p>AN Argument of late eſpecially, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten treated of, and perhaps in this great Audience, and truly for great reaſon. It may be hoped there is leſs need of it now; I am ſure there are great hopes that there will be; when ſimplicity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and piety have more ſeaſoned the firſt ſources of manners and opinions. However, I doubt there may be ſome need of it ſtill: The God whom the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Fool denies, only knows when it will be otherwiſe. Good men would rejoyce to ſee the time (and it may come) when it ſhall be as ridiculous to doubt of the Being, Attributes and Providence of the true God, as it is of the Sun's Being in Heaven, and its influences upon this Earth; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104491:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> it now is too in it ſelf, and to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man's thinking in a right method.</p>
            <p>But let us briefly run over the words, read, and ſee what inſtruction they will afford us to diſcourſe upon. By the term <hi>Fool</hi> it is well known, that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generally is not meant only an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or erroneous Perſon, but alſo one who is wicked and of ill-manners, becauſe he knows not, or miſtakes his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, as well as departs from his Duty. The Hebrew word is here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies him that doth foul, as well as fooliſh Actions. So <hi>Nabal</hi> is ſaid to have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Name, when he was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and churliſh to <hi>David,</hi> as well as ſo fooliſh and imprudent; that had it not been for <hi>Abigail,</hi> by ſparing a little he had loſt all, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 25. And the Syriack Verſion here renders the Hebrew word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> an unjuſt, wicked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Man.</p>
            <p>2. It follows, <hi>hath ſaid in his heart,</hi> i. e. he hath thought ſo, though perhaps he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dared to ſay ſo; for that was Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and therefore death by the Jewiſh Law.</p>
            <p>3. There is no God, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is no ſuch thing really exiſtent; 'tis but a name
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104491:65"/> or an imagination. Or if he be any where yet he is not preſent upon this Earth; he meddles not with humane Affairs. Some fooliſh, wicked Men, in their thoughts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny either the Being, or the Providence of God, extending it ſelf to this lower World. Like the Ancient Sect of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greeks, long after theſe Fools of the Pſalmiſt; and conſequently the true and neceſſary Perfections and Attributes of his Nature, his Omnipreſence, Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Omnipotence, his Univerſal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (whereby he governs and directs the whole Univerſe at once) to the beſt Ends, his Sanctity, Juſtice, and the like. And further conſequent to this, they deny all diſtinction between Moral good and evil, right and wrong, vertue and vice, other than the preſent gratification, and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their own luſts of haughtineſs, pride, violence, covetouſneſs, voluptuouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſort of Men the Pſalmiſt here more particularly means by the Fool. Nay, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; hence it muſt neceſſarily follow that they were, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Jews ſpeak, <hi>i. e.</hi> they denied their Religion, deſpiſed even the Authority and Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were Judaical Infidels, as ours now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days are Chriſtian ones; which is the more uſual ſignification of the word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104491:66"/> to revealed Truths. This laſt ſenſe wants not Equal probability with the former. For it is likely, that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Mankind, there have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, who have queſtion'd the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and true Attributes, than the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a God, for want of the true noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Nature, and therefore the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe ſeems not to have done amiſs, when it paraphraſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the fool hath ſaid in his heart</hi> that God hath no Dominion or Government in the Earth.</p>
            <p>4. The words, <hi>they are corrupt, they have done abominable works,</hi> &amp;c. may be looked upon with the coherence, either of a cauſe or an effect of the preceding Propoſition. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart,</hi> &amp;c. As if they ſhould be thus uttered. Becauſe they are corrupt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that extremity of folly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, as to think there is no God at all, and that he doth not ſee and know what they do; or if he doth, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or will not concern himſelf to puniſh them. Or we may read then to this ſenſe: Fooliſh and lewd Men have firſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves that there is no God, or no Providence which reacheth humane Affairs, and then have let looſe the Reigns to their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104491:66"/> luſts, which have carried them to the moſt wicked Works, and abominable Practices.</p>
            <p>From whence we may learn theſe Two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they who deny the Being or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God over Mankind, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Truths mentioned, are both igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and wicked; or infidelity is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of vicious Fools. <hi>The fool,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the denying of thoſe great Truths, and ſuch like, is the cauſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners; or infidelity is followed with ſtill greater corruption of manners, and wickedneſs of practice.</p>
            <p>To take the firſt of theſe.</p>
            <p>Among many heads of Diſcourſe, which have and may be handled, in this great and moſt important Argument, I ſhall chooſe but theſe Two.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> To obſerve ſome of the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent cauſes of this Diſeaſe. And,</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> To propoſe ſome remedies to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or ſuppreſs their Efficacy.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And becauſe thoſe of both parts are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be named, I ſhall be as brief as I can in each of them; and do little more than enumerate them.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:104491:67"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> The firſt cauſe then of this infidelity is ignorance. A charge which perhaps they may wonder or ſmile at, who have ſo often been by themſelves, and others taken for more than ordinary Wits; and ſo indeed they are, but 'tis in levity, ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs, temerity, ſelf-conceit and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſome other as worthy qualities to be mentioned. And we affirm ſtill, that one of the leading and firſt Cauſes of infidelity is great ignorance of the Nature of all Beings, ſhort of infinite Perfection, and particularly of the material or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real World, to believe it poſſible for any thing to exiſt without a God, or a Being, whoſe Eſſence is to be infinitely perfect, and conſequently neceſſarily to exiſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to be the productive and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Cauſe of all other things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exiſtent: And then when there is ſuch a Being, it is to have loſt the faculty of reaſoning, ſeriouſly to deny thoſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of his Nature before mentioned, and his Univerſal Providence. For it would be to ungod him again. It muſt be from a groſs ignorance more particularly, for any man to doubt his Univerſal Goodneſs, whereby he diſpoſeth and ordereth all things for the beſt State of the Univerſe of Beings, in all its duration taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104491:67"/> and conſequently his Juſtice; ſo that it ſhall be better with the Good and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, than with the Evil and Wicked, all Conditions or their whole Duration conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and comprehended.</p>
            <p>It is from no better Cauſe, that any man queſtions the Immortality of humane Souls in their own Nature, and the unſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the Divine Attributes to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate them. And it is far more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and further from all belief, that God ſhould make our Souls <hi>only</hi> for this point of time we live upon this Earth, than that he ſhould make all humane Race to come into this World only to cry and die.</p>
            <p>'Tis (I ſay it again) from a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance of the Nature of Body and Spirit, the Nature of God, the true Ends of all Being, Life and Action, that theſe grand and fundamental Verities are ſeriouſly, and <hi>ex animo,</hi> diſputed or denied by any. It would be at preſent too tedious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to deduce at large, the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proofs of theſe moſt important Truths. It hath been eſpecially, in this laſt Age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well performed; to which in ſome things a further Addition may be made. Let Infidels or Scepticks ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwer that firſt: I think we may without vanity, challenge all the power
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104491:68"/> and force of their Wit and Learning to do its utmoſt. Let us ſee if they be in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whether they be not extremely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and (if we may have the leave or pardon of this Royal Audience, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them with a great, but juſt reproach) whether they be not both bold and bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh: Of which the ſecond Cauſe of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity will give ſome Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> And that is the difficulty of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and conceiving thoſe intellectual Objects, which are abſolute. Such as are the Properties and Actions of God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, humane Souls, whence ſome have concluded them to be mere Words and Talk, or miſtaken for ſome corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Such are thoſe, who firſt beginning at the ſubſtantiality and immortality of the Soul, proceed to deny the Providence, the Attributes, and at laſt the very Being of God; impudently affirming, nothing can be conceived by us but Body, and that which belongs to it. This miſerable Infirmity of humane Nature, confines the noble Soul of Man, to the moſt ignoble and dead part of the Univerſe, deprives it of its greateſt pleaſure and perfection, and debaſeth it both in its knowledge and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in its perceptive and active Powers. The men who are moſt liable to it, are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104491:68"/> thoſe of much ſecular Buſineſs and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, perpetually taken up with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and reaſoning, and plodding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſenſible objects and affairs of this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Life.</p>
            <p>And ſome there are running ſo far to the extreme of this ſide, as to give little, either encouragement or opportunity to any other knowledge or employment of the mind of man, beſides Mechanicks Trade and civil Juſtice, as if all other things were mere Chymera's, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, fruitleſs, empty Notions, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deſerved our regard, but only how to handle a Tool well, or to buy and ſell, or at the higheſt to prevent or decide a Controverſie about an Houſe, Field, or Fence, and other little Properties. Which indeed are at preſent neceſſary, and of great uſe for Temporal plenty and peace; but are not in the leaſt to be compared to the goods of the Spirit, and to the hopes, acquiſition and enjoyments of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Alas, how little do ſuch men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or conſider, that if all the furniture of this momentany bodily Life be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by God, and uſed by us for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal good things, it is ſcarce worth our coming into Being at all, much
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104491:69"/> leſs undergoing the manifold uneaſineſſes, incommodities, cares and calamities of it. The effects of this humour and genius in a Nation, to which lapſed and degenerate Mankind are prone enough, for ſome ſmall time prevailing, ſeems to be profound ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and oblivion of intellectual and heavenly things, the increaſe of Atheiſm, irreligion and prophaneneſs, Immorality in heart and life, any further than it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſecular intereſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Laws of civil Society.</p>
            <p>For which one reaſon, it ſeems highly expedient, or rather abſolutely neceſſary, to ſet a-part one order of men, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number with places, and other proper and convenient Circumſtances, to preſerve and improve the knowledge and eſteem of ſpiritual and heavenly things amongſt Men, otherwiſe truly in great danger to be loſt: And without which we ſhould live like the Fiſh and Mole, as ignorant of the nature and privileges and felicity of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our World, infinitely the vaſteſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt part of the Univerſe, as they are of ours.</p>
            <p>It is more than likely ſome men may be content with it. But ſurely they will be ſo humane and charitable, as not to hinder, but to help thoſe which are not.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:104491:69"/>
            <p> It is certain that the two great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between that part of the World which is called barbarous, and that which is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, are intellectuality and charity; and ſo far as we loſe either, we return again to Barbariſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> Another moſt frequent and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Cauſe indeed of infidelity, is licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Men would live as they liſt, and gratifie and indulge their luſts to the full, without any fear, reſtraint or allay. And becauſe their conſciences are at firſt more or leſs troubleſome, they endeavour to bribe, corrupt, and bring them over to their party; to tell them that they may ſafely and honeſtly too, follow ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For that which is ordinarily believ'd (ſay they) and talked of vertue and vice, and difference of Actions, except only from agreeableneſs and preſent pleaſure; of God, his Sanctity and Juſtice, of Heaven and Hell, of Reckonings and Recompences hereafter, are but imagination and talk, or falſe, or at leaſt dubious things.</p>
            <p>Theſe men do the Work throughly of debauching, and eternally ruining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they do not only hire their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to be ſilent or ſtand Neuters, but to give their luſts all poſſible aſſiſtance and encouragement; like ſome who have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104491:70"/> fought deſperately in a bad cauſe, not without conſcience, but with one as bad as their cauſe. And here theſe Perſons who will ſuffer themſelves to be thus abuſed by their luſts, ought timely to be aware in what great danger they are, not only to deny the Lord that bought them, but alſo the Lord that made them with all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ever Reaſon and Nature hath taught; and conſequently to be deny'd by them.</p>
            <p>4. In men of an haughty ſpirit; that very temper of theirs is a frequent cauſe of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, they will needs be uncontroulable by any, and not endure any bounds to their deſires and enjoyments, but what they pleaſe to ſet themſelves. It is for ordinary and low ſpirits, and not for ſuch great minds as they are (ſo ſay their flatterers, and they believe them) to ſuffer themſelves to be reſtrained by any Laws of Nature, Reaſon or Religion, or to depend upon any Being whatſoever ſo much, as to hope or fear from him; and therefore they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are any ſuch things. Men who ſpeak as big as <hi>Pharaoh, Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him?</hi> Exod. 5. 2.</p>
            <p>Poor creatures! who though they are not a jot wiſer or better, and truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively very little greater, than other
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104491:70"/> meaner Mortals; yet they'll aſpire to the Prerogative of God their Creator, to whom by reaſon of his eſſential Sanctity, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Juſtice, all comprehending Wiſdom and Almighty Power, it only belongs to know no other Laws, but thoſe of his own Nature and Will, and to court no Power ſuperior to his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> We may add to theſe a certain gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit in ſome men. Theſe hate all care, attention, reflection and foreſight, which contract the ſpirit, and cauſeth it to gather it ſelf together; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they like not to hear of or believe, nay they are reſolved to disbelieve every thing which may diſturb the ſecurity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the liberty, or darken the gayety of their minds. It is plain, if we entertain and ſettle in our minds the great practical Truths of revealed and natural Religion, they will oblige us to make uſe of ſome prudence and attention; to direct our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by certain Rules to a certain End; and not to leave our ſelves to a tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous boonneſs of ſpirit, and to the fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous tides or ruſhes of our appetites and paſſions. So it hath been ſaid of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Epicureans,</hi> that their Excluſion of their Deities from humane Affairs, was recommended by them as a comfortable
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104491:71"/> dogm, freeing Men from all fear and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, to pleaſe or diſpleaſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly,</hi> Sometimes in ſome men infidelity hath proceeded from a ſowerneſs of mind, great diſpleaſure conceived and fermented into an impatience againſt God and his Providence: Perhaps their impetuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires have been croſſed, their darling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns broken, and their jolly hopes fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or their ſweet enjoyments ſuddenly ſwept away from them; whence firſt they have entertained very hard thoughts of God and his Providence, and broken out into rude and unmannerly expreſſions againſt them. Then in revenge proceeded to wiſh them out of the World, and at laſt have thought it more eaſie and ſafe to deny them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly,</hi> In others again an affectation of ſingularity and deſpiſing what is common, an humour of contradicting of what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily believed diſpoſeth to infidelity. Becauſe the generality of men do believe thoſe great truths ſo often mentioned, therefore they will not. They would ſeem more ſearching, or fortunate or bold in their diſcoveries and opinions, than all the World beſides. They would appear to know, or at leaſt dare to ſay, that which the generality of Men have been ignorant of, or that which, if ſome few of the more
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104491:71"/> curious and inquiſitive and penetrating have thought as well as themſelves, yet they had not the courage to publiſh it. Now theſe men are under a far more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous prejudice from affectation of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and novelty, than the generality of men whom they uſually deſpiſe are, from Antiquity, Cuſtom and Example.</p>
            <p>If we conſider both theſe abſtractedly, it is far ſafer to follow common received opinions of many Countries and Ages, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if believed of great importance, than the new inventions of one or ſome few.</p>
            <p>Though both may be falſe, yet if no other reaſons be conſidered, the old is much more likely to be true than the new. And I believe it is the experience of thoſe who impartially examine things, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the common and well near univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally received opinion of all places, and ages (eſpecially if thought of great conſequence whether true or falſe) are at laſt found in the main part of them to be true. And it is one of the beſt Employments of men of great Wit, and more than ordinary ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity and capacity, to conceive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them more clearly and diſtinctly, and to pare off and ſeparate ſome abſurdities and falſhoods, which may in ſome tract of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104491:72"/> time, by paſſing through many unskilfull hands, have been faſtned to them. But of this more will be ſaid, when we come to the remedies of infidelity.</p>
            <p>8. (To add no more at preſent) Envy againſt the Profeſſors, but of Ingenuity, Philoſophy and Sobriety, much more of Religion and Piety; eſpecially, if attended with any thing of Dignity, Reputation and Revenue hath been the Cauſe, I doubt, in many ill-tempered and ill-living Men of this Infidelity.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe at firſt out of this ill-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and quality feign to themſelves, and then induſtriouſly bring themſelves to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, that the things are frivolous or falſe, for which Men of Learning and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have been thought worthy of their Rewards of Eſteem, Honour and Revenue. And what's the Cauſe or Reaſon? No other but that their Eye is evil, and they would not have them to enjoy them. They do not well abide it, to ſee them in poſſeſſion of that, which either they would have themſelves, whether deſervedly or not, or at leaſt no body elſe. Others again, ſpeak meanly or diſgracefully of their Doctrine, Opinion, and Profeſſion; becauſe they ſpoil the Reputation of their manner of life, and are inconſiſtent with that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104491:72"/> and liberty which they profeſs, practiſe and delight in. Hence it is, they give them the bad and contemptible names of Pedantries, uncertainties or falſhoods. Here we may take in another ſort of men, which are but ſervants and attendants to the former, thoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> who get their live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, and ſometimes more, by the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, contentions, quarrels, perjuries, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickedneſſes of the Age.</p>
            <p>Theſe two, as far as their Wit and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt will go, help on and promote the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of all ſober, vertuous and religious Principles.</p>
            <p>Theſe and others, which may be ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are the inward Cauſes, and inherent in our ſelves, of unbelief and disbelief, and which are moſt in our own Power, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or remove.</p>
            <p>There are alſo ſome others external and occaſional, ſuch as the Example of witty and acceptable Company; Hypocriſie in Religion both revealed and natural (ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſeeming at leaſt) eſpecially in the Teachers of them; when men profeſs they believe their grand Truths, but do not live in any ſort, as if they did. Which accuſation is partly falſe; for the generality of men, though they do not indeed live near up to their Faith, yet they would be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104491:73"/> much worſe without it. Partly it is to be put to another Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> heedleſneſs and want of application of their belief to their practice. But perhaps few things have been more an occaſion of the Infidelity of ſome men, than the over-zealous and blind Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of others. Some men's believing too much, and otherwiſe than they ought, and yet fiercely impoſing it, hath been the Cauſe of others believing too little, and ſometimes they who have moſt complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Scepticiſm and Infidelity, Unbelief and Disbelief (which are different things) have contributed much to it themſelves.</p>
            <p>The introducing of many Opinions of neither light or uſe, or very little either way, uncertain or trivial; nay, ſometimes not only juſtly ſuſpicious, but manifeſtly falſe, and then the impoſing them under what Penalties men have in their own Power, the leaſt of which is commonly the Cenſures and Reproaches of <hi>Enemies or Indifferents in Religion, Hereticks, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Infidels:</hi> I ſay, theſe have begotten and extremely nouriſhed Scepticiſm and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, eſpecially in this knowing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive Age, bold when they dare, lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and doing more miſchief oft-times when they dare not ſhew themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be examined and receive their Anſwers.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:104491:73"/>
            <p> This is the infirmity of thoſe well-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men, who will have every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and impoſed too, which ſeems to them to make for the honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Religion, not minding what ſhould be in the firſt place known, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or falſe.</p>
            <p>But it is the wickedneſs of thoſe who do it for their own ſecular intereſt, and care not how much Mankind be abuſed; ſo that their Domination be advanced and ſecured, at leaſt they connive at it, and let it paſs.</p>
            <p>This Cauſe hath its effect principally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ingenious and witty, the great and haughty, but not wiſe and juſt, who want either leiſure or patience, or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or probity, to examine and diſtinguiſh things. They eaſily throw away the Wheat with the Chaff; what is true and ſolid, with what is falſe and light.</p>
            <p>'Tis alſo probity of mind they want, who being licentiouſly given, and no great friends to any Religion or Truth either, which may lay any reſtraint upon them in their opinions or practices, gladly take any advantages againſt them.</p>
            <p>That men look upon all profeſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Conſcience to be Ignorant, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, or Cunning; ſo that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104491:74"/> or Reaſon are of no Authority with them. Neither doth this humour ſtop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this ſort of men, but it is ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the vulgar too, who ſoon learn to contemn Religion, and the Prieſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in times of liberty.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is to be adviſed, (and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Religious men, wiſe and honeſt, who heartily deſire the Advancement of true Religion will ſo do) that we be firſt aſſured of the truth of our belief and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Religion, and be now carefull and juſt to appear for nothing but what is ſo, and for that reaſon. And when we cannot fairly maintain any thing to be ſuch, tho' it appear never ſo much for the honour and intereſt of Religion (as many very falſe and forged things have) let it reſt, and go as it is till time may further diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And as for the vulgar, it is ſurely their ſafeſt way to rely upon the Conduct of ſuch wiſe and honeſt Men, though they may be even exhorted to ſee with their own Eyes too if they can. For it is much more eaſie for them to know who are ſuch, than to judge themſelves of the truth and falſhood, Univerſal conveniencies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of things, to know who are the beſt Guides, than to guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:104491:74"/>
            <p> This plain dealing without fraud or force, will ſurely much advance the juſt Eſteem of Religion, and its Miniſters, and conſequently its influence and efficacy.</p>
            <p>We have but too much proof of this Cauſe of Infidelity from experience. We have ſeen ſome Men, and that of the firſt rank, who have taught us ſuch a God, and that out of his own Books, which others judge to be an abſolute impoſſibility: And yet after all, they will be the only Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and reprobate all thoſe who will not be of their opinion. Many alſo are thoſe, who have made the Holy Scriptures, the moſt excellent Collection of Writings which were ever extant, to ſpeak ſuch things, which hath cauſed others not brooking their Interpretations, nor being ſufficient to find out better themſelves, to have mean and injurious thoughts of them. And yet if any pious Man with the ſincereſt intentions, and endeavours to preſerve, and vindicate their due honour by ſalving dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, which ſeem to check Reaſon, do advance any thing inconſiſtent with their ſettled Opinions and Syſtems, he is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irreligious and a ſevere Atheiſt, too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Cenſures, whatever their miſtakes may be. But they are much more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtill, who have made up ſuch an
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104491:75"/> Hotch-potch in Religion, by their Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Holy Scriptures, from preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or enthuſiaſtical Revelations, forged or falſe Miracles, Traditions, Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority and Infallibility, as firſt, to turn men's Stomachs againſt it, and at laſt, to cauſe a great many quite to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves of it altogether. But of theſe, and ſuch like, I ſhall ſay no more at preſent: But go on to the next general Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> To propoſe ſome remedies proper to prevent, or repreſs the influences of theſe Cauſes of Infidelity; whereof ſome are more general, ſome more particularly relating to ſome Cauſes and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> To adviſe and aſſiſt Men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and advance their Knowledge to the higheſt Degree they are capable of. For it ſeems juſt to deal ſo uprightly, and plainly with the World, as not to make uſe of mere Authority, inſtead of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſon, where men are truly capable and honeſt; though, where they are ignorant, but yet conceited, ſelf-willed or diſhoneſt, in things of importance and conſequence, Authority muſt be allowed to interpoſe for their own, and the publick
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104491:75"/> good, which otherwiſe would greatly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Let therefore Men know, as much as they can, and examine theſe great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities with the greateſt ſeverity. Aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more they know, the more reaſon they will ſee to believe them ſeriouſly, and reſolutely to live according to them. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the unbelieving Jews <hi>(John</hi> 5. 39.) to convince them that he was the promiſed <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the Perſon to whom all his Characters there did agree. So ſay we, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> Nature it ſelf, and Reaſon too, for they bear witneſs of all theſe great Truths. But then ſearch them throughly, examine them to the bottom, ſee clearly, reaſon carefully and juſtly; weigh all things with indifferency and impartiality; which will be preſently a direction by it ſelf. Otherwiſe, as the Jews did erroneouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Holy Scriptures, and conclude from them: So may Men here through want of patience, and attention, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, err and miſtake in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, concerning the great Truths of Morality and all Religions.</p>
            <p>We heartily deſire, that men's Faith and Belief may be the effect of a plain, ſerious and deliberate Conviction, more than of Cuſtom, where it may be. And truly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104491:76"/> then, as well as when it is wrought in the heart by the grace of God, (which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Cauſe mentioned in the Scripture) great is its Power, and forcible its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and life it ſelf is at its devotion and ſervice. Such was the effect of it in all the Apoſtles, and particularly ſuch is the Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, mentioned of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> when one cries out, <hi>my Lord, and my God,</hi> and the other, <hi>Lord whither ſhould we go, thou haſt the word of Eternal Life.</hi> Let that then be the firſt remedy againſt Infidelity, <hi>viz.</hi> the utmoſt improvement and beſt exerciſe of our knowledge and reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly,</hi> Poſſeſs we our minds with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and zealous Honeſty and Probity. By which, I mean, a ſtrong habitual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion and inclination to that which is right and juſt. This will have three Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects very proper to beget, or confirm a right belief of the Truth, and to preſerve us in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> A fervent love of the Truth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> A free and ingenuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of it, where-ever we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, be it for us, or be it againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A deſire to act ſuitable and live according to it.</p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:104491:76"/>
            <p> I ſay, a ſincere and reſolute Probity hath theſe effects. For ſurely, never any honeſt man doubted whether it was mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, more fit and juſt (of better effect) for a good man who will make good uſe of his knowledge, to be knowing rather than ignorant, or to believe the truth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a lye, in order to direct him in all his inward Motions and outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Without the firſt, we ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves to ſearch, or find the truth. Without the ſecond, when we know it, we ſhall either not believe, or deny it if poſſible; or if by the clearneſs and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we cannot do that, yet we ſhall turn our minds away from it. Finally, without the third, we ſhall little eſteem or uſe it. And indeed, the firſt, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with the other two. For he that hath a great affection for truth, will readily embrace it where ever he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it, endeavour to recommend, and make the beſt uſe of it he can, ſhewing what influences it hath upon his heart and life. This excellent quality of our Spirits, is more than once commended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Holy Scriptures. 'Tis this which our Saviour means in his Parable by the <hi>honeſt and good heart, which having</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>the word, keeps it, and brings forth</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:104491:77"/> 
               <hi>fruit with patience,</hi> Luke 8. 15. It was the want of this, which was one of the Cauſes of the ſeduction from the Verity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in thoſe who periſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> Not only the Goſpel, particularly called the truth, but of truth in general, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. And it was this our Saviour, above all things, required in men to become his Diſciples. And 'tis for this reaſon, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the incomparable evidence of the truth of Chriſtian Religion, that it is to be believed, that never an honeſt man of capacity, who hath been rightly inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the principal Doctrines of it, hath long held out againſt it, and finally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed it. We may add to this natural effect of probity, the extraordinary and ſupernatural one, even in thoſe who may be for ſome time doubtfull, or erroneous in thoſe greateſt Verities (ſo perhaps may God permit.) It procures God's eſpecial care, to enlighten and encline ſuch to the reception of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly,</hi> Another cure of this Infidelity is a branch of modeſty; that is but a juſt and true eſteem and value for our ſelves, and therefore particularly to be carefull, we entertain not too great a Conceit of our own ability and ſufficiency above other
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104491:77"/> mens, to find out the falſity or weakneſs, or uncertainty in common receiv'd opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conſequence. If we ſeem to our ſelves to obſerve it, let us ſtill be diffident of our own Judgment, and believe we may be miſtaken, and that there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them, or for them, which we do not yet ſee; and therefore reſerve the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of our belief to further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thoſe who are ſtrongly conceited of their knowledge and ſufficiency in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above other men, and are hugely pleaſed with it, are very forward and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to ſhew it to themſelves firſt, and then to other men; more eſpecially in contradicting and correcting what is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taught and believed, and that by the moſt eſteem'd, and of the beſt Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Authority.</p>
            <p>The Holy Scripture hath given us this general advice alſo. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Not to think too highly of our ſelves, but ſoberly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> But becauſe ſome men in their Infidelity, may rely more upon the Wit and Learning of one whom they much eſteem, than upon their own, it is to be adviſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly,</hi> To have a great deference and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the moſt publick Teſtimony, or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104491:78"/> to the moſt general received Opinion; ſo much the more ſtill, by how much it is larger in reſpect of places and ages.</p>
            <p>The leaſt effect, this conſideration ought to have upon us, is to make us cautious and ſuſpicious, when we are inclined to believe and advance any Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, becauſe it appears true to our ſelves, or ſome few other really knowing men. We ought diligently and impartially to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what it is, in the common Opinion, we cannot perſwade our ſelves to be true, and how ſuch a general miſtake ſhould come to paſs. He that contradicts an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal belief, had need be the wiſeſt of men, and he that rejects a very general one, ſhould be very wiſe. The firſt is not to be done without a Demonſtration, and even that which ſo appears to us is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to be ſuſpected; though, till we ſee otherwiſe, it cannot be denied by us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in a thing a thouſand times conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and debated, it may ſeem much, that none before hath light upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, though I do not ſay it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. And, as for thoſe perſwaſions which are very general in things judged of great concern, and conſequently, moſt frequently brought into converſation, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and practice, it had need be a very
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104491:78"/> great evidence; and having lain long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der variety of examination, is at laſt alſo generally approved, that ſhould entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or diſplace them. Yet I deny not, but a man may have ſometime a reaſon ſufficient at firſt to ſuſpect, to doubt, to ſay, that the new Opinion looks with a good countenance, and ſeems not to want a fair probability. And then it ſeems no more than Juſtice, and a thing becoming the publick Care, that it ſhould have a fair hearing.</p>
            <p>But here too, that we be not impoſed upon, we are to take a true account of the Univerſality, or Generality of received per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions; not call thoſe of one Nation or Country, or perhaps one quarter of the World, introduced, and maintained by mere intereſt, cunning and force, or of one, or ſome few Ages; I ſay, we muſt not call theſe univerſal, or more general than indeed they are. This is the fault and folly of the Roman Church, which will needs have Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Image and Saint Worſhip, and an hundred others, to be the Catholick Opinions, and Practices in the Church of Chriſt; when we can produce whole Countries and Nations greater than theirs now, and many more Ages, and the beſt even of their own Church,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104491:79"/> which neither believed nor practiſed ſuch things.</p>
            <p>This remedy is proper againſt blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſingularity, whether out of ignorance or affectation. I will add but one more, and ſo have done with this general head alſo. And that is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> That as it hath been already a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Advice to poſſeſs our minds throughly with probity and plain honeſty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a prevalent love of the truth: So it will much help and aſſure the effect thereof, to purge them of all prejudices which may oppoſe it; and to leave truth and honeſty as few, and as weak Enemies in our Breaſts as it is poſſible for us. We muſt therefore turn out, and ſend away all unreaſonable Inclinations, Humours, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Paſſions, which may have any influence upon our underſtanding, and judgment, in our enquiring or aſſent to any truth: We are to keep our minds ſincere and upright.</p>
            <p>This will prevent or repreſs the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of many Cauſes of Infidelity at once. For in purſuance and application of this general Direction, we ſhall free our minds from the love of any luſts, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and moſt unreaſonable deſire of liberty, uncontroulableneſs and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104491:79"/> from pride, vain ſelf-conceit, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ſingularity, from the humour of ſetting our ſelves in good earneſt to oppoſe and contradict, from wrath and impatience againſt God Almighty and his Providence: from ſpite and envy againſt knowledge and goodneſs, and good men, againſt their reputation and intereſt in the World; and finally, from Scepticiſm it ſelf (or as I now take the word) from timidity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, inſtability of judgment and aſſent, in which there ſeems ſome paſſion and inclinations without reaſon, as well as in all the reſt. Then ſhall we be clear and free to believe the truth, merely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the truth, as far as we can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and for no other reaſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Till we have thus cleanſed our ſouls, depoſed and laid aſide all theſe prejudices, the more ingenious and witty we are, the greater is our danger of error and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and the common ſort of men who have not ſo much Wit, Haughtineſs, Self-conceit, and Pride, do with much more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſecurity, follow the eaſie and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Senſe of their own minds, and the common belief of the World, who are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than themſelves.</p>
            <p>And now, what uſe ſhall we make of this whole Diſcourſe? I ſhall make but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104491:80"/> one inference from it; and that is, If what we have all this time been delivering be truth and reaſon, as I hope it is, then it is our Duty to contradict the <hi>Fool</hi> here in the Text, and that two ways, both in his Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and in his conſequent Practice. Hath the vitious <hi>Fool ſaid in his heart there is no God,</hi> or no Providence: Let us deliberately, peremptorily and decretorily conclude in our hearts, and confeſs it with our mouths, that there is a God, and verily, that this God judgeth in the Earth. But then let us be ſure, boldly to oppoſe and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him in the conſequence of our Faith, elſe our Faith and Profeſſion will ſerve us to no purpoſe, but to condemn us out of our own mouths, or it will be ſuſpected, that our inward Faith and outward Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion do not agree; that we ſay one thing as loud as any, and think another. At leaſt, that our Faith is very ſlight, cold and rare, and therefore little valued by us. For a ſerious, expreſs, firm and frequent Faith, or actual Aſſent, eſpecially after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation or doubting, is a great matter and very operative. We ſee the ſettled Opinions of men in other Affairs of Life, how ſturdy and forcible they are. They govern even their Paſſions, and Perſons, and are difficultly maſtered, or hindered
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104491:80"/> by any oppoſition. So would it be alſo in Divine Faith, if it were as well rooted in our hearts, and as frequently made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual uſe of. Is then this wicked <hi>Fool</hi> corrupt, and vitious? Hath he done abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Works? Let it be our firmeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and utmoſt care and endeavour, to be of an incorrupt, ſound and ſtrong Vertue, and a laudable and amiable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and do good Works. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and immediately, the Vertue which our belief in God, his Nature, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes and Actions ſhould produce and preſerve is that of Piety and Religion, or Divine Worſhip, in which I comprehend all our Duty to this God. Let us then ſpare him as many thoughts as we can, and contemplate his Beauty and Glory, as much as our frail Nature and Condition will bear; let us conceive the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily of him; let us honour him with all the force of our Souls, love him with all our might above all things together, both in Heaven and Earth; rejoyce and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his Favour, and fear his diſpleaſure; put our ultimate truſt in him alone, and above all, entirely reſign up our Wills to his, in whatever is to be done or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by us, and all his Creatures; that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104491:81"/> his Will may be done both in Heaven and Earth. This which is the internal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, we are at all fit Seaſons and Circumſtances, to ſignifie by our Lauds, Praiſes, Prayers, Thankſgivings, ſolemn Profeſſion of a ſincere, univerſal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, perpetual Obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Appointments, and above all by the Tenor of our Life and Actions, which is External Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Behold a heart and life ſutable to our Faith, and to the God in whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. An employment worthy indeed of all reaſonable Creatures, from the higheſt to the loweſt. The perfection of all their noble Powers and Exerciſe of them. This Religion and Converſation with the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the higheſt Accompliſhment and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of any ſpiritual Nature. All other objects do not fill their Capacities. This State we are all here as much as we can (which is but little) to endeavour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to. The reſt we are to deſire, hope, and prepare our ſelves for.</p>
            <p>Now to this God, whom the wicked <hi>Fool</hi> denies; who made and upholds all things by the Omnipotent Word of his Power, and governs all things by his All-wiſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; to this one moſt excellent infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104491:81"/> Nature in three Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all this inward and outward Worſhip, conſtantly rendred by Men and Angels, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, and for ever-more. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>THere are hardly any words of the Holy Scripture, more common in the Mouths of Chriſtians, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reformed, or uttered with more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or more frequently made uſe of, than theſe of <hi>Juſtification by Faith.</hi> Nor is there any Doctrine of Chriſtianity, which hath of late been diſputed, with more Volumes or greater Heat, than that which is ſaid to be contained under them.</p>

               <p>I ſhall at preſent, only, briefly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour, the explication and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words.</p>
               <p>The two things which deſerve a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular explication are, (1) <hi>Juſtification,</hi> (2) <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <ptr target="#A29503-NOTEA"/> 1. For the word <hi>Juſtification.</hi> I take the original and general Notion of it to be, the doing by any Perſon (for to that I now reſtrain it, though it be ſpoken of Actions alſo) as uſeth to be done to one who is juſt and righteous: <hi>i e</hi> ſome way to ſhew favour, or to do good to him, whether by approbation, commendation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104491:83"/> or beneficence. Of this general ſenſe of the word, it is eaſie to ſee that the juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Senſe of acquitting abſolving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is but one inſtance or kind.</p>
               <p>This uſage may be in reſpect of ſome particular Act, or Quality only, or of a man's general Temper of Mind and Courſe of Life. We have ſeveral Examples of the firſt. It is ſaid by our Saviour of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, who went up with the Phariſee to the Temple to pray, that he went away rather <hi>juſtified</hi> than the other (or juſtified, and not the other, according to a known Hebraiſm.) juſtified! <hi>i. e.</hi> accepted, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God, in that particular Act of his Prayer to God, as uſeth, or ought to be done to him who is juſt, and doth well. The ſame is the Senſe of the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. 'Tis God that <hi>juſtifieth,</hi> who is he that condemneth? We know the World doth condemn, reproach, hate us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for our Religion, for our believing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus: but that we deſpiſe, becauſe we know too, that we have the favour and approbation of God for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Thus alſo it is recorded of <hi>Phinehas, Pſalm</hi> 106. 30, 31. that he executed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſlew <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> in the Act of Uncleanneſs) and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs, or for <hi>juſtification,</hi> or the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104491:84"/> effect of it was <hi>juſtification</hi> (for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, have often the ſame ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21.) <hi>i. e.</hi> he was, and ought to be, and ever ſhall be unto all Generations greatly approved, and highly praiſed for that Action in ſo eminent a degree, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and juſt, done with ſo much Zeal and Courage for the Honour of his God, and the good of his People. And we read too, how he was rewarded by God for it with the high Prieſt-hood in his Family. Nay, the <hi>juſtification</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, is ſaid ſometimes to be in the ſame ſenſe, for ſome one particular eminent Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 17. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 21. though at other times for his general Faith, and Piety, or obediential Temper to God. And of this <hi>juſtification</hi> he is ſet forth as an eminent and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Example, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. So it is in like manner with all good men, who walk in the ſteps of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, <hi>viz.</hi> who are religious, obſequious to the Will of God, in what manner, and whenſoever he ſhall ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently make it known to them; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently men of ſincere Probity of Spirit, devoted to all that is good and juſt. Of which hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:104491:84"/>
               <p> This uſage of a juſt man, or <hi>juſtification</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed into (1) negative, or doing him no harm: (2) poſitive, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to him, beſtowing certain bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and poſitive favours upon him. But there are three more remarkable inſtances of both theſe, and frequently mentioned in the Scripture. The firſt is remiſſion of ſins upon repentance, or an omiſſion of puniſhment for them: like as one that hath been juſt, and never committed any ſin, uſeth to be treated. He ſuffers no evil from God for ſin, and this is negative. The ſecond is the Holy Spirit's influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, operations in the Souls of Men. And the third is Eternal Salvation upon perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in a good and holy life. All theſe are more particularly regarded by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text: As if he had ſaid. Therefore being by Faith (of which preſently) reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Favour of God, particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the forgiveneſs of ſins, the gift of the Holy Spirit, the promiſes and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Eternal life, we have peace with God. We are in a ſtate of Amity and Friendſhip with him, and we have Peace and Tranquility in our own Conſciences, which do not now threaten us with God's Anger or Puniſhment, and that through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:104491:85"/>
               <p> Now if this be the true notion of <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> when it is joined with Faith, as I think it is: Then firſt, it is not the ſame with <hi>ſanctification,</hi> or making a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, holy and juſt. Juſtifying the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly through Faith in the Scripture-ſtyle, is not making an ungodly man godly, as the Papiſts, <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> would have it. A miſtake in that learned Man, which hath led him into many other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations of Scripture. Nor (2) is it in a ſtrict Senſe an accounting or rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning a Man perfectly juſt, or more than he really and truly is: for that were to ſay, that God may be deceived, and judge things otherwiſe than they are. It is true, the Church of <hi>England</hi> in one of her Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles hath uſed the words, <hi>accounting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the merits of Jeſus Chriſt by faith, and not for our works.</hi> But there needs no force to make them ſignifie, <hi>the treating or uſing as righteous,</hi> for the Merit of Chriſt upon the condition of Faith, without any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on our part, which is the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine of Juſtification, as we ſhall preſently ſee. Nor (3) is Juſtification to pronounce or declare a Man inherently juſt, as it were in a ſolemn Sentence, who is not ſo; for this were to make God give a falſe ſentence. Nor (4) is it to cover or
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104491:85"/> cloth a Man (even a penitent ſinner) with the pure Robes of Chriſt's perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and then to appear to God, pure and ſpotleſs, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: For this were to ſuppoſe God to look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the outſide, and repreſent him like old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> deceived by <hi>Rebekah</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the notions of men, who ſeem never to attend to the proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things: but are content to talk only in Figures. And in truth they might do much more harm, if they were not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidoted by other plain Scripture Doctrines; ſuch as that of the neceſſity of Holineſs of heart and life for the forgiveneſs of ſins and everlaſting Salvation. Nor (5) is Juſtification God's imputing the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt to Man, who lives in any ſinfull Breach or Neglect of God's Law.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a comfortable and true notion under thoſe phraſes; and that is, That ſinners fare the better for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Righteouſneſs, or perfect Obedience of Chriſt. Great and many indeed were the benefits God was pleaſed to afford ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mankind, for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. No leſs than ſuch as theſe; his long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and forbearance, all ſorts of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bleſſings, all the inward and outward means of Vertue and Goodneſs; All this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104491:86"/> even to ſinners while ſinners; which ſome learned men have called degrees of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins: I ſhould rather ſay inſtances of <hi>juſtification,</hi> or dealing by men as uſeth to be done to the innocent and juſt, who had never offended. Then further, upon true repentance, entire pardon for all paſt ſins: All in the other life, and all in this, except, what God in his fatherly Wiſdom may think fit for our diſcipline and means of further improvement in Vertue and Holineſs; conſtant forgiveneſs upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant repentance, for the interfering faults of good Men, and finally, Everlaſting life. All this Men owe to the compleat Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the End of his life. It was for his ſake, God was pleaſed to have any regard to, or compaſſion upon the degenerate Race of Mankind; that God might by ſo eminently rewarding him, ſhew the World how acceptable to him Holineſs and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were, and encourage to the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the higheſt Degree of them poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. All this is true, and a reaſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of God in the Government of the World. But yet it is not Juſtification it ſelf. God's imputing Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us in ſuch manner, is one Cauſe of our Juſtification: but Juſtification it ſelf, or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104491:86"/> the uſing of us in ſuch favourable and kind manner is the effect of that imputation. Nor (6) and laſtly, is Juſtification a bare remiſſion of ſins. They who ſay ſo, ſpeak too little: for the uſing a man as a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and juſt man is not negative only, or doing him no harm; but poſitive, alſo doing him good; and therefore it contains not only ſecurity and exemption from the evil of ſuffering; but the beſtowing the good things of enjoyment, the principal of which are, ſpiritual and eternal; the Aſſiſtances for Vertue here, and Heaven hereafter, or Grace and Glory as is uſually ſaid. I will only here obſerve, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch as I have ſaid, be the general notion of Juſtification of ſinners: yet it muſt here in the Text be reſtrained to thoſe inſtances of favour, which follow Faith taken for a quality in us: ſuch as remiſſion of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe it is ſaid <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by ſaith.</hi> Faith is the Cauſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <hi>viz.</hi> a condition qualifying, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitating Cauſe. Juſtification, or being uſed kindly by God, is the effect of this our Faith. And ſo much for the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Term Juſtification.</p>
               <p>In ſumm, this it is to uſe or treat a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as uſeth to be done to a juſt and good man, which is to do him no harm, but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104491:87"/> to bear him good Will, ſome way or other to do him good, ſhew him favour and kindneſs.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond Term <hi>faith,</hi> I mean, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying or ſaving Faith, by which we are ſaid to be juſtified, it is as much conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and perhaps with more difficulty and leſs certainty reſolved, than the former of <hi>juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I for my part have obſerved theſe three ſignifications of it. The laſt of which I intend principally to enlarge my preſent Diſcourſe upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The firſt Senſe of it may be Piety, or Religion in general, or rather <hi>religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> i. e. Such an habitual Temper of mind, whereby a man is diſpoſed to obey the Will of God: and conſequently to do that which is right and juſt, however made known to him from God. It is this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Soul by which God eſtimates a good Man, and by which he is qualified for God's Approbation, Acceptance and Beneficence. Particularly in thoſe great Inſtances of Pardon, Grace and Glory. Which if vigorous and prevalent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant enough to denominate us good men, will certainly exert it ſelf in all actual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of inward Will, and outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it is not neceſſarily hindred, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:104491:87"/> it may be, by pure and invincible Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, by Diſeaſes and Diſorders of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or any external Impediments. I ſay again, becauſe I think it wants and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Obſervation, that it is according to the Degree and Conſtancy of this habitual Inclination of Soul that God eſtimates us, and we ſhall be dealt withall by him. Outward Actions, eſpecially, and inward too are contingent, may ceaſe, and are liable to an hundred Hindrances and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, when the habitual Inclination of the Will is a conſtant thing, and remains fixed in the Soul; which God certainly knows, though others, and even our own ſelves ſometimes may be ignorant of it, ſo that the Jews from whom probably the <hi>Mahometans</hi> had it, might ſave themſelves and God the labour of caſting up, and weighing their good and bad Actions, to know which Number weighs moſt, and how the Caſe will ſtand with them in the Day of Judgment, any further than they are ſigns of the Degree and Conſtancy of habitual Temper, ſometimes fallible enough. But let this ſtand for a little Digreſſion. To return,</p>
               <p>I cannot yet tell what better notion to fix upon <hi>faith,</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> quoted by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:104491:88"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11. from <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. to prove Juſtification not to be by the Law, but by Faith; and that too Synecdochical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put, <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtification for all the reſt of the Goſpel-doctrine concerning it, as we ſhall preſently more largely diſcourſe. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> i. e. A good and juſt Man by his Piety and Religiouſneſs ſhall be in the Favour of God, ſo as to be ſafe and happy, when the proud and wicked Man forſaking God, ſhall be forſaken by him. An habitually Religious man, which will certainly produce actual Obedience to God, whenſoever he ſufficiently declares his Will and Laws, ever was, and ever will be approved, accepted and favoured by God. Which as he did once by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo hath he in theſe laſt days more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly by his Son the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Wherefore it is not neceſſary, that the juſt Man ſhould live, or be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only by the actual Obſervance of the Moſaical Law, which is what the Apoſtle proves by theſe words. Let us examine a little the importance of the whole Verſe, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. and <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith: but if he draws back</hi> (ſo it is to be rendred, there being no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there, but ſuppoſed to be put in by our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104491:88"/> in favour of the Doctrines of abſolute Election and Perſeverance; <hi>My Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> We ſhall not meddle with the difference of the <hi>Heb.</hi> in <hi>Habb.</hi> and this quotation by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but only obſerve, That <hi>to live,</hi> is to fare well from God, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by him, and be in his favour, ſo as to receive from him the Promiſe of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Deliverance from their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Condition here, or after this Life the reward of a happy Condition, or both; or as it is expreſſed in the next Verſe, <hi>the ſaving of the Soul.</hi> This, I ſay, is the ſenſe of <hi>living</hi> (as it is commonly of the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) becauſe, <hi>God's having no pleaſure in him,</hi> i. e. God's disfavour, is oppoſed to it. Beſides, in the <hi>Gal. To live</hi> (not only <hi>vivere,</hi> but <hi>valere)</hi> is plainly of the ſame importance with Juſtification, in the latter part of the Verſe.</p>
               <p>And then for Faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is manifeſtly the believing of God's promiſes ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as to produce an entire, ſubmiſſive, and obſequious Temper of Heart to God, and conſequently an actual Obedience, and doing the Will of God in the profeſſion and practice of the Chriſtian Religion; becauſe it is oppoſed to a Man's withdrawing <hi>(viz)</hi> from that his Duty to God, through fear
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104491:89"/> or diffidence, or any other evil Affection. And it is of the ſame importance with that in the following Verſe, <hi>believing to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul,</hi> by which a good Man lives. Faith, by which a good Man lives, cannot be either according to common reaſon, or the Tenor of Revelation, a bare Aſſent to God's Veracity, Goodneſs and Power, or the fulfilling of his Promiſes; but the effect thereof, a dutifull and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential Heart to God. It was in the ſame manner, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified <hi>(viz.)</hi> by his Piety, and generous, obediential Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Soul towards the true God; ready and prepared cheerfully to receive and execute all his Commands though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo difficult, at all times. And as he was then juſtified by that pious Temper of Heart, manifeſting it ſelf in actual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Commands of God then laid upon him: So ſhall we Chriſtians (ſaith St. <hi>Paul)</hi> if we be of the ſame pious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Soul with <hi>Abraham,</hi> exerting it ſelf in an actual Obedience to the Laws of God now declared, and enjoyned by Jeſus Chriſt. Nay, we may add, That the Jews themſelves (though they little underſtood it) were all along juſtified upon the ſame Condition too. Not ſo much by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the particular Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104491:89"/> as ſent from God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they ſtiffly contend (moſt of which were but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and fitted for the particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of that People) as by that devout Temper of Love, Reverence and Obedience to God, declaring his Will for that time by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And where-ever that Temper was among the Jews, it had the ſame effect of actual Obedience to God by Jeſus Chriſt, when he was ſufficiently preached, and made known to them. True, ſincere Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Love of Truth and Goodneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing againſt all worldly Intereſt and Prejudices, brought the Jews themſelves moſt certainly over to Chriſtianity. If we would know more of this Temper by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we may ſee the 119 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> thoſe of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, into whoſe Hearts and Minds God will put and write his Laws, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16. thoſe whom our Saviour calls his Sheep, who know, hear his Voice, and follow him. And what is ſaid of the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Lo, I come, (in the volume of thy book it is written of me) to do thy Will, O God.</hi> Theſe are the Perſons, this the Qualification, Condition, and Capacity for God's Favour, Approbation, Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Reward; or in one word, for his <hi>Juſtification;</hi> A ſubmiſſive, obediential Temper of Heart to God.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:104491:90"/>
               <p> I ſay a Qualification or Condition of God's Favour in general, and particularly expreſſed in remiſſion of ſins: which by no means excludes the Conſideration of Chriſt's Obedience and Sacrifice, which ever was another Cauſe of Juſtification from the beginning, and ever will be. This ſenſe of Faith, <hi>(viz.</hi> Piety) will not be thought ſtrange by thoſe who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Hebrew way of ſpeaking. Thus we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> that the Iſraelites <hi>believed</hi> in the Lord and his Servant <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104491:90"/> they had heard any one <hi>particular</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law from God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonial, as Circumciſion, Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Moral: and if any of them then died (as no doubt ſome did) they were alſo ſaved.</p>
               <p>Nor is the reaſon of this ſignification of <hi>faith,</hi> when it is joined with Juſtification and Salvation, leſs eaſie. 'Tis becauſe Faith in its ſtrict and primary Senſe of <hi>aſſent</hi> to ſome Truths, neceſſarily preceeds this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſneſs of Heart, this habitual Piety. A Man muſt firmly believe, that there is right and wrong, moral good and evil, that the Will and Laws of God are the moſt infallible Rules of it, that he will reward and puniſh the Obſervers or Tranſgreſſors of them, before he is effectually reſolved, or habitually diſpoſed, univerſally to be obedient to God, and to pleaſe him, as the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath it <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. In like manner, the love and fear of God are every where uſed in the Scriptures Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdochically, for all Religion and Vertue, becauſe thoſe Affections, in their ſtrict and proper Senſe, produce in us a diſpoſition of Soul to univerſal Obedience to him, and conſequently all Inſtances of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Such may be the firſt Notion of <hi>juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or ſaving Faith.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A ſecond is more particular and limited, and that is an obedient Temper of Heart to God, making known his Will and Laws to us by Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the true Chriſt, or by being a Chriſtian. It was one of the principal Errours of the Jews, againſt whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> in various places diſputes, about the Point of Juſtification, that they would admit no other Condition of it, than the Obſervance of the Moſaical Law, which he calls the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Works of the Law.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> maintains againſt them, that it was not: but a vertuous and holy Temper of Soul, which loved Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hated Iniquity, and conſequently moſt deſirous to know and do the Will of God, when, and in whatſoever Inſtances he ſhould pleaſe to declare and reveal it. But more eſpecially, and particularly, now by Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> deſcribed, foretold, and promiſed to their own Nation.</p>
               <p>He was now appointed by God to be his Vicegerent, and Legiſlator under himſelf to all Mankind to the End of the World, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was for a certain time only to the Jews. Now God expects and requires Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Obedience to his Laws by this Jeſus, from all Men every where. All, I ſay, to whom this Declaration of his Will
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104491:91"/> ſhall come, and particularly from the Jews, to whom he was preached by himſelf and other Diſciples. Which if they did, and perſever'd, they ſhould be <hi>juſtified</hi> by God, and in his Favour, particularly receive from him remiſſion of ſins, the Holy Ghoſt, and Eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> Some have named a third Senſe of <hi>faith,</hi> and that is Faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively taken, or the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or if you pleaſe, the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For Religion objectively taken, I would call a Doctrine revealed from God: or a Syſtem of revealed Doctrines, and that which is by Jeſus Chriſt, the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Religion, ſo that Juſtification by Faith, is the ſame with Juſtification; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Chriſtian Religion; and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Law, or Works of the Law, is Juſtification according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Moſaical Law. Not that which <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf really taught, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but that which the Jewiſh Doctors, the Interpreters of that Law, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Jews, taught and believed in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time. Such may be the ſenſe of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God by faith,</hi> i. e. taught by the Goſpel; and then fitly follows the particulars of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104491:92"/> in the four next Verſes, and <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>We conclude that a man is juſtified by faith,</hi> without the deeds of the Law; and <hi>v.</hi> 30. It is one God which ſhall juſtifie the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion <hi>by faith,</hi> and Uncircumciſion <hi>through faith.</hi> See alſo <hi>Gal</hi> 3. 17. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6. And truly ſuch a kind of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Speaking, ſeems agreeable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to that of the moſt Ancient and Modern Jews; Nay, I think, to one who never ſo little conſiders, it is plain. For the Righteouſneſs of God, and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of Faith, or by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 3, 6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22.) are the ſame thing. But the Righteouſneſs of God is manifeſtly that way or method of Juſtification (all the Cauſes of Juſtification together) which God had appointed after the Coming of Chriſt under the Goſpel, and which Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles taught. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> there, as frequently elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22. 30. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31.) is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as appears from the oppoſition of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Righteouſneſs of God, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 2.) to that of the Jews own Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>To interpret that of inherent or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteouſneſs is not probable, though it may be a poſſible ſenſe, which ſenſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104491:92"/> of the word is yet more plain from <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>with the heart man believeth to righteouſneſs, i. e.</hi> to <hi>juſtification.</hi> From hence it follows, that the Righteouſneſs of Faith, is the way of Juſtification by God's Appointment, and Command preached by the Apoſtles the Miniſters of the Goſpel, or Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Again, the Righteouſneſs of God and of Faith is oppoſed to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law, of the Works of the Law, of their own Righteouſneſs, and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own Righteouſneſs of the Law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. and therefore muſt have the ſame kind of ſenſe. But theſe Righteouſneſſes are all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly no other thing than Juſtification, according to the Doctrine and Belief of the Jewiſh Doctors of the Law, the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Jews, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Converſion to Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>And what if we ſhould reduce the other two Senſes of juſtifying Faith to this laſt, and ſay, That Faith where it ſignifies pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, the Condition or qualifying Cauſe in us of Juſtification, as hath been explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may be taken Synecdochically; a part for the whole, one part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine concerning Juſtification, and that which was more earneſtly conteſted by the Jews, for the whole of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. A thing ordinary enough in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104491:93"/> Style of the Holy Scripture. Nor do I ſee it beſides the mind of the Apoſtle. Beſide, if this ſenſe be but equally probable, it will be the beſt taken, becauſe it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the other two.</p>
               <p>Now to know what were the principal Differences between the Doctors of the Jews, and Chriſtians concerning Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are to conſult both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Jewiſh Authors themſelves.</p>
               <p>And, as I think, we may therein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe Five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Jews were of opinion, that there were ſome men who needed no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification at all, no favour of God in that particular of remiſſion of ſins. Some of theſe they thought had never ſinned in all their lives; the other again by their own ſtudy and exerciſe, became without all faults, and their exact Righteouſneſs made recompence for their paſt Tranſgreſſion. Theſe they called perfectly Righteous, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as they had two ſorts more to appear in the Day of Judgment, <hi>(viz.)</hi> perfectly wicked, and a middle between both; when as <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fanſie God will make uſe of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Poc. ad por. Moſ. not. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Tal. Roſch. haſch. c.</hi> 1.</note> Scales, to weigh good and bad Works one againſt the other; and if the Scales happen to be even,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104491:93"/> mercy will weigh it down on the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſide. Of this ſort among the Jews might be the Phariſee, who went to the Temple with the Publican to pray, for he recites only his religious Actions, but ſaith not a word of any thing ever ill done. And it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. that our Saviour ſpake that Parable againſt certain which truſted in themſelves that they were Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And the occaſion of the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 13. is ſome Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was an opinion among the Jews, that there were ſome men who need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no repentance. Perhaps St. <hi>Paul</hi> might once reckon himſelf among theſe perfectly Righteous, when he knew no better; for he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>That touching the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which was in the Law, i. e.</hi> in Vogue and Reputation among the Lawyers or Doctors of the Law, <hi>he was blameleſs Phil.</hi> 3. And I remember ſome-where in the Talmud, to have read of ſome Maſters of ſuch perfect Sanctity, as never to have committed one ſin, and to have been ſuch from, and in their Mother's Wombs, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> is ſaid to be; which there ſignifies no more, than his being ſo early by God deſigned and ſeparated to his Prophetical Office and Employment. Now this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theirs St. <hi>Paul</hi> denies, affirming
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104491:94"/> that all Men (except the Bleſſed Jeſus, the true <hi>Meſſias)</hi> have been, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſome Degree, or other, Sinners; and that all Men therefore ſtood in need of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Repentance and Remiſſion; That Jews and Gentiles have all fallen ſhort of the Glory of God, and were guilty before him; That even the beſt of the Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were not exact Obſervers of their own Law, eſpecially in the inward and moral part of it. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> proves out of their own ſacred Authors, which he quotes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, <ref target="#A29503-NOTEB">(b)</ref>
                  </hi> The Jews held generally, that there was no need of the Merits or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of any other, no not of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> himſelf, for whoſe ſake Juſtification or Remiſſion of Sins, particularly, ſhould be granted by God: But that Repentance, good Works, Faſtings, Prayers, Sacrifices, Oblations, temporal Puniſhments, or final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, corporeal Death were ſufficient for the expiation of all ſin whatſoever. Or if any thought that there were any ſins to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given for the <hi>Meſſias</hi>'s ſake, as ſome few of the Ancients thought <hi>
                     <ref target="#A29503-NOTEC">(c)</ref>,</hi> yet theſe were but few, and reſtrained the Privilege to thoſe of their own Nation, and Religion: and laſtly, however they would not hear of ſuch a thing, as that it was for the ſake of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104491:94"/> Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom they denied to be their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and rejected with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſcorn. To this St. <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth three things, and maintains, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God ever did, and ever would juſtifie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſinners, upon Conſideration of, and with regard to the perfect Obedience and Sacrifice of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and not without it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this great Favour and Indulgence of Heaven was extended to all mankind. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> was this true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And that all this, as it was in it ſelf moſt reaſonable, ſo was it agreeable to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and now with ſuch undeniable Proof, and clear Evidence, declared to be the Will of God, that it was not indeed any longer to be diſputed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Jews advanced yet further and affirmed, that their Repentance, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Sacrifices, and all other their good Works and Qualities, were not barely a capacitating Condition of Juſtification, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins, and the happy Life to come, but meritorious; and that God was obliged in Juſtice to give theſe for them. And as for the perfectly Righteous who needed no Repentance, no queſtion but that God was ſtrictly bound to reward them with a future, happy State of Life, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104491:95"/> at the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the Day of the great Judgment.</p>
               <p>Nay, when they wanted Merits of their own, they had recourſe to thoſe of their Anceſtours, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and others; like the Works of Supererogation among the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſome were ſo beſotted with vain Conceit and Arrogance, that they thought God choſe their Anceſtors for their Merit, and was in love with their Poſterity for it too. And ſtill there remains among them an Enthuſiaſtical and Arrogant ſtrain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all this, probably older than St. <hi>Paul;</hi> That God created the World for their ſakes, foreſeeing, I ſuppoſe, what a lovely and excellent People they would prove. We need but look into both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Jewiſh Authors to learn all this. Though, if we knew nothing of this their Arrogant Opinion and Temper from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet the Holy Scripture would ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inform us <hi>
                     <ref target="#A29503-NOTED">(d)</ref>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo zealous for the Honour of God and Jeſus Chriſt, moſt deſervedly in his diſputes with them about Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, repreſſeth and refutes ſuch inſolent and falſe Opinion and Language. And therefore aſſerts the Righteouſneſs or Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of God, or of God's Appointment
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104491:95"/> by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, deſcribed and taught in the Goſpel to all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. This way of Juſtification of God's Appointment was firſt to believers, <hi>i. e.</hi> real Chriſtians in their hearts and lives, And then through the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus the propitiation; and laſtly, freely by the grace of God. This, God's way of Juſtification being thus, upon the Condition of our Chriſtian Obedience, and Conſideration of perfect Obedience, and Death of Jeſus, and of the free grace of God, every way excludes the boaſting of the Jews; which they thought in their way they had ſo much reaſon for. This Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God was neither without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the perfect Obedience and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Jeſus the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> nor by any Merit of theirs by which they may claim Juſtification, as a Debt from God. Nor was it ſo much, as upon Condition of the Obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (of which preſently) much leſs upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its Merit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the Jews had ſo great an Opinion of the Merit of their Father <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> He affirms, that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was juſtified in the ſame manner too. He was juſtified by Faith too; taking Faith firſt for a godly, religious Temper of Heart
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104491:96"/> as the Condition; and then this one part of the Goſpel-doctrine of Juſtification for the whole of it, by a Figure ordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as hath been before obſerved. But he denies peremptorily, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by his Works of any ſort, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he was juſtified either according to their Doctrine in general, or more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the Merit of his Works.</p>
               <p>He doth not deny Juſtification by good Works, as a Qualification or Condition, which is the Senſe of St. <hi>James</hi> writing againſt an Errour of ſome Chriſtians, who taught a bare Belief in Jeſus, and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it enough. And it is likely they had it from the Jews too; the Vulgar of whom thought their mere being Jews ſufficient for Salvation.</p>
               <p>Nor hath either the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church ever wanted ſuch ſort of People, and very numerous too; eſpecially in times and places of great ignorance, when their idle, ignorant and corrupt guides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have taught them as much. St. <hi>Aug.</hi> tells us, that there were ſome in his time, who believed all to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Civ. Dei lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</note> who gave Alms, who ſaid daily in the Lord's Prayer, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes,</hi> &amp;c. and did forgive when ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104491:96"/> ſometimes; who remained in the Church, however they lived otherwiſe. And he believes there were many in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time too, who not rightly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 80. <hi>quaeſt.</hi>
                  </note> underſtanding St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Juſtification by Faith without Works did really think, that having once believed in Chriſt, they ſhould be ſaved by that Faith, though they lived wicked and flagitious Lives. Thoſe Chriſtians in St. <hi>James</hi> ſeem ſuch a ſort of People: And if the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> was written before that of St. <hi>James,</hi> they alſo might be led into ſuch a Conceit by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf miſunderſtood (not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what he had otherwiſe by word or writing every where taught) and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For with the heart man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, (i. e.</hi> Juſtification) <hi>and with the mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it is obſervable, how one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Perſons who are written to, and their Opinion, may determine the ſenſe of words. St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Jews, who affirmed, that their good Works merited Juſtification; St. <hi>James</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who believed, and taught that they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104491:97"/> were not ſo much as a qualification or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and no way neceſſary to it.</p>
               <p>They both wrote true: Juſtification was, and was not by good Works. It was by them as a qualification and condition, it was not by them as meritorious in the moſt received and common ſenſe of that word. But to return to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he flatly denies that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was juſtified by the Merits of his Works, ſo as that God was in manner of a Debtour obliged to it; much leſs was his Poſterity. <hi>Abraham</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was a Perſon extraordinary, and ſo might juſtly pretend to ſome privilege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men: but had no reaſon to claim or challenge any thing; particularly, ſo great things as remiſſion of ſins, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from God, merely for his own ſake, or in ſuch manner as a Creditour or Servant, may do from his Debtour or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine of his ſo directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theirs, he proves from <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> for one ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith (his Piety and Obedience) was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs or Juſtification; and the other, bleſſed is the Man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin. Now this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>impute,</hi> imports in God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of payment of a Debt, nor of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104491:97"/> from him: but an Act of Diſcretion, Liberty, Choice, Goodneſs; though moſt wiſe and reaſonable too, in purſuance of the one great End of all his Counſels and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: This was the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles elſe-where, as if it were a matter they much deſire Chriſtians ſhould be well inſtructed in.</p>
               <p>And in truth it is moſt agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon: For to talk of Merit in its proper ſenſe, and ſo as it uſually ſignifies amongſt us, between God and the beſt of Men, or the moſt excellent Angel, is to give a very falſe Idea of the Caſe. For to merit from any one, is firſt to profit or advantage him ſome way; and then it is to impart ſome-what of his own; and laſtly, he that receives the Benefit, is bound to requite it by ſome Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ſuperiour to himſelf. Now there is nothing of all this, between God and his Creature. For, can a Man profit his Maker? A Maſter indeed may be benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the labour and ſervice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Next the ſtrength, induſtry, and fidelity of the Servant, is his own in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Maſter; he never had any of this from him. But what have we, which we have not received from God? Our very Being, Faculties, Liberty, all kind
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104491:98"/> of Ability and Capacity, are they not the free gifts of our great and good Creatour? Finally, what Law is there ſuperiour to God's own Nature and Will, to oblige him to any Action? who can, or ought to ſay to him, What doſt thou! not ſo much in reſpect of his irreſiſtible Power (for there is no Tyranny in Heaven) as his all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Wiſdom, his immutable Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and eſſential Goodneſs: It is true, there is ſuch a thing as juſt and right, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and unchangeable: But it is therefore ſo, becauſe God is ſo. It was eternally a property of the Divine Will (if I may ſo ſpeak) as truth was of the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. It is his own immutable Nature to do that which is right and fit. That which we call right, fit, juſt, is a due Relation, or Habitude of all Will, Action, Power to its Object; which Object is <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> good, and that the greateſt too in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of intention, extenſion and duration, (and there can be no more reſpects.) This is the ultimate, due End and Object, I ſay, of all Will, Action, and Power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. But this Relation or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eternal and immutable, only becauſe God is ſo. It could never have exiſted without a Subject, and that Subject the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will exiſts neceſſarily. The very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104491:98"/> or Exiſtence therefore of any ſuch thing, depends upon the Exiſtence of the Divine Will. Beſides, this Relation which we call <hi>Right and Juſt</hi> is ſomething, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it as all other ſomethings, muſt have the Will of God or active Power, or his Nature for its Cauſe. But though Right and Juſt depend upon the Divine Will for its eternal Exiſtence; yet we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it ever ſeparated from them, or without them: We cannot but conceive it a pure perfection, and therefore cannot but attribute it to God, an All-perfect Being.</p>
               <p>For an inſtance or application; we ſay, that the Object of God's will, is always the Univerſal good, the good of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the greateſt good, either fit or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in order to this he wills, <hi>benè bonis, malè malis,</hi> he juſtifies the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and condemns the Wicked: He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and diſtributes reſpective recompences of rewards and puniſhments to the good and bad; the quantity, quality, time and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances are to be left to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom. But this proceeds from no Cauſe without the Divine Will it ſelf. We cannot but conceive the Divine Will thus to act. There is no Power or Will to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine or conſtrain it. God's Nature is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104491:99"/> ſuch, that we cannot but conceive him to will, and do that which is juſt and right, (for the greateſt good of all reaſonable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) and yet moſt freely, becauſe it is his own immutable Nature: for what can be more free than what is natural? Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in God is not an indifferency (for that would be an imperfection) but that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite force and delight with which he acts. I have no better words to expreſs my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by. Liberty and Neceſſity therefore in God are not only conſiſtent, but inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. It is right and juſt for God to reward the good, who keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and obſerve his Laws, which are the infallible Rules and Inſtances of what is right and juſt; but we muſt not ſay God is bound to it, or that thoſe who are good merit it from him, in a ſtrict and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Senſe, and common Uſage, becauſe that imports, as if he muſt do it whether he would or no, and there were ſome Law or Perſon without, or ſuperiour to himſelf. We may and ought to ſay, that God moſt certainly will do ſo, becauſe it is his own immutable Nature to do it. <hi>The Righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs, and his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance beholdeth the upright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true (to put an end to this not uſeleſs, or very impertinent Digreſſion)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104491:99"/> that worthy Qualities and Actions, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as do effect or but tend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, that are uſefull or beneficial to the World, do juſtly entitle any Perſon to a Reward, ſuch as Honour, Power, Wealth or pleaſurable Life, becauſe thoſe ſame Qualities and Actions are thereby maintained, increaſed and propagated, and conſequently the beſt and happieſt State of the World, furthered and advanced. Every one in his place, and according to his Ability, is bound to this, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all ſorts of Governours. And ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities have, and may with good reaſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Name of Merits amongſt Men, and in reſpect of them in its moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and received ſenſe. For they are the property of thoſe who poſſeſs them, they never received them from other Men, they are beneficial and uſefull to Men, and there is a ſuperiour Law and Power to oblige, and compell Men to reward them, none of which can be ſaid in reſpect to God. Though it being a congruous and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing, as is above mentioned, God always doth, and always will, neceſſarily from his own Nature, will and act in ſuch manner. And if there be no more meant by <hi>meriting</hi> than that, we may ſafely in ſuch a ſenſe be ſaid to merit from God too.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:104491:100"/>
               <p> And in this ſenſe it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that God is not <hi>unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,</hi> Heb. 6. 9. And <hi>benceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> It is a congruous and fitting thing of beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect certainly in God's Government of the World, that good Men ſhould be ſo uſed by him.</p>
               <p>I have been ſome-what the longer in this Digreſſion, becauſe I believe the whole Controverſie about Merit, between the Jews and St. <hi>Paul</hi> with his Chriſtians, and between the Pontificians and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, may, by the little that hath been here ſaid, be eaſily cleared and decided. At laſt we conclude then with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Goſpel-doctrine againſt the Jewiſh Doctors, and the legal Doctrine which they taught, <hi>viz.</hi> That we ſinners are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by God, and more particularly upon our repentance and perſeverance in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart and life, pardoned and ſaved, not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, not by any Merit in us from him, in its proper ſenſe as hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; but according to his Mercy, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104491:100"/> by the free grace, and undeſerved good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. Tit. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another Doctrine of the Law, or of the Jewiſh Doctours concerning Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification was, that admitting all Men to be ſinners, and God to juſtifie them with conſideration of the perfect Righteouſneſs and Sacrifice of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that this <hi>Meſſias</hi> was Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and that none of their own qualities and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were truly meritorious of ſo great a favour from God: yet the neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification or condition of Juſtification to all Men, thoſe at leaſt to whom the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law was made known, was the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of all the particular Commands of that Law. For that Law was certainly from God, and (as they deemed) never to be changed. Inſomuch that the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> himſelf, was not to aboliſh the leaſt Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of it: but to cauſe it by his Authority and Power to be more punctually, and ſtrictly obſerved. And here St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to do not only with the unconverted, but converted Jews alſo. For a multitude of them, who believed Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and remiſſion of ſins through his Name, yet were zealous of the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 21. 20. And ſuch were the whole Sect of Chriſtians, called
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104491:101"/> 
                  <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> as ſome of the Fathers report. They believed the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was not to change the Law, but to explain, confirm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
               <p>This opinion of the Jews, St. <hi>Paul</hi> with much Zeal and Courage oppoſeth: And one of his Arguments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. four laſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is to this effect: If God juſtified ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs, nay even you your ſelves, <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Diſciples, upon the qualification of an obediential Temper and Diſpoſition of Heart to the Commands of God in any inſtances, and howſoever he ſhall be pleaſed to declare them, and particularly thoſe by <hi>Moſes</hi> to you Jews, till the coming of the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> to declare God's Will, and give Laws in his Name to all Men, granting you, that the Doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified, till that great Prophet the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. I ſay if this be ſo, as I have proved in the Caſe of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Patriarchs; then, why may not God now alſo, ſince the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is come, even Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> invincibly proved to be the Perſon by Prophecies, Miracles, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Aſcenſion, Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, juſtifie all Sinners, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles upon the ſame condition of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition of heart, exerting it ſelf in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104491:101"/> Obedience to his Will and Laws declared by this Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> the true <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Why may not God make an alteration in the particular Condition of his Favour, <hi>i. e.</hi> his particular Laws, the general one, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential and pious Temper and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Soul to God, and conſequently to what is right and juſt remaining always the ſame? why may he not do it now by the <hi>Meſſias</hi> after <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he did by <hi>Moſes,</hi> after all the Holy Men before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Patriarchs your Anceſtours? why may not God make the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of his Will and Pleaſure, with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, Addition, Abolition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as <hi>Moſes?</hi> And ſuch I believe to be the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that obſcure and unuſual way of ſpeaking to our Ears, but perfectly of Jewiſh Style, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Say not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul)</hi> did ſay indeed, and that from God, that the man which obeyed God's Law by him ſhould live, <hi>i. e.</hi> have his Favour and Bleſſing. But now the ſame God ſaith by Jeſus the Chriſt, and by us his Apoſtles, that he hath ſent the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> even this Jeſus, the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet foretold and promiſed even to you, and that if we believe and profeſs him to be the Chriſt, and conſequently be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to, and hear him in the Name of God,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104491:102"/> we ſhall be ſaved. Or in ſhort Terms: God indeed did formerly command you if you would be happy to obey <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Name; now he commands you to obey Jeſus the Chriſt himſelf, ſent now by him to you and all mankind. Before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Appearance of Jeſus the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> the Condition of Juſtification to you Jews was, Believe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Obſervance of the Laws of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but now both to Jew and Gentile, and all to whom Jeſus is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Condition is, believing in Jeſus, becoming his Diſciples, obſerving his Laws, and keeping his Words. It will not be amiſs a little to paraphraſe theſe few Verſes, to make the ſenſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle eaſe and clear, beginning at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Verſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I believe (ſaith St. <hi>Paul)</hi> and openly declare it, that many of my Brethren, the Jews, are truly zealous for God's Honour, and their Duty. But they are unhappily at this time, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and miſtaken in both. They do not think of, or rightly conceive God's way of Juſtification; part of which is, doing it upon conſideration of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs, and voluntary Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias;</hi> and this ever was, and ever will be,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104491:102"/> from the beginning to the end of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. So is alſo another part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the general Condition and Qualification in us for it; namely, a pious and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Temper of Heart to God: But the Application of this general Condition is new, namely, Obedience to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Laws of God by Jeſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> any further than they are, according to his primitive and univerſal Laws of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Nature, or repeated, allowed, and confirmed by this Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>And being thus ignorant of God's Method of Juſtification, they go about to continue and eſtabliſh their own way without Jeſus Chriſt, and will have the particular Obſervance of the Laws given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to be neceſſary, and which they ſtill imagine and believe now and ever to the End of the World ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. But they ought to know, that now Jeſus Chriſt is come, he hath put an end to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> All who believe him to be the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (and all ſhould to whom he is preached) are to have no more regard to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as their Legiſlator and Maſter now, but to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, irrefragably proved and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the true <hi>Meſſias. Moſes</hi> did ſay,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104491:103"/> and truly in his time (and for ſo long time as it pleaſed God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the <hi>Meſſias)</hi> that if the Jews his People hoped for God's Bleſſing, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Reward, they muſt be of an obſequious and obedient Heart to God, and with reverence obſerve thoſe Laws in particular, which God had moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to deſcribe and enjoyn them, as a Condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But now Jeſus the <hi>Meſſias</hi> hath been ſent from God to you, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with infinitely greater proof of his Miſſion from God, than ever <hi>Moſes</hi> was; both he, and we commanded by him, teach and preach that all Men who ſhall hear our Doctrine, and have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſufficient inſtruction in it, are not in the leaſt to doubt, (it being an exceeding manifeſt and plain thing) but that this Jeſus is this <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but are to believe it firmly, and profeſs it boldly, and conſequently to become his Diſciples, particularly ſhewing their Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and their moſt religious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Heart, Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, by the Obſervance of his Will and Laws by this Jeſus the Chriſt, if they intend to be ſaved. Obedience to God by <hi>Moſes</hi> was, now Obedience
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104491:103"/> to Jeſus Chriſt is, and ever hence-forward will be (as the Jews falſly imagine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Law) the Condition of, and Qualification for the Divine Favour, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Remiſſion of Sins, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salvation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Such may be the Senſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo we may ſuppoſe him to have ſpoken to us in thoſe obſcure words.</p>
               <p>The only thing of moment which the Jews had to object, and which converted and unconverted to Chriſtianity were very fond of, was the perpetuity of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> clearly as they thought affirmed in their Law and Prophets. But this St. <hi>Paul</hi> every where abſolutely denies with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and with great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For beſides that that Law is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be obſerved by all mankind; neither <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf, nor any of the Prophets ever affirmed it. Nay, they have intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the contrary, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf promiſeth the Jews, <hi>That the Lord their God would raiſe up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like him, whom they ſhould hear, Deut.</hi> 18. with <hi>Acts</hi> 7. This, as it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a Succeſſion of Prophets, ſo it had a principal Reſpect to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who was a Perſon ſent immediately from God with larger Authority than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to be heard by them: Not as they too meanly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104491:104"/> thought of him, as if he were to be only the Servant and ſecond of <hi>Moſes.</hi> No, he was to be a Law-giver from God like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and to take and leave what he thought fit in his Law. And ſo the Prophecy is only compleatly fulfilled in the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> None of the Prophets were ſo like <hi>Moſes</hi> as he.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Meſſias,</hi> only, was a Legiſlator from God like <hi>Moſes.</hi> 'Tis true, none of the Talmudiſts, Paraphraſts or Rabbins, that I remember, have apply'd this place to the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> but neither have they done that by many other places where they fairly might, and with much more reaſon than where oft-times they have.</p>
               <p>But it is enough, if <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, never really and in truth affirmed the perpetual Duration of the Law. For now God hath given abundantly more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Proof of his Miſſion of Jeſus, than ever he did of <hi>Moſes;</hi> by his Doctrine, Life, Miracles, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon them who believed in Jeſus, and not upon the Jews: and from this Jeſus, I have learned (ſaith St. <hi>Paul)</hi> that a great part of the Moſaical Law ſhould be aboliſhed; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in order to the uniting all Mankind into one Body by Religion; That Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104491:104"/> and Uncircumciſion now availeth nothing (to Juſtification) but Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Love: A religious and obedient Heart to God by Jeſus Chriſt, producing all the ſubſtantial Actions of Piety and Charity to God and our Neighbour, the ſumm and end even of the Mcſaical Law it ſelf; that no man who now believeth in Jeſus ought to oblige himſelf, by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, to the obſervance of all the little temporary, and now uſeleſs things of the Moſaical Law. Nay, if he doth, Chriſt ſhall profit him nothing, as being diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to one expreſs Command of Chriſt, liberty and freedom from that compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively mean inſtitution. Such then is the fourth falſe Doctrine of the Jews concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Juſtification.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> In few words: The Jewiſh Doctors taught, that they might perform and fulfill all the Commandments of their Law, by their own natural Strength and Power <hi>
                     <ref target="#A29503-NOTEE">(e)</ref>,</hi> but St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Divine Writers, teach a contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; <hi>viz.</hi> That the grace of God is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for our performance of good Works, or rather for being good men; the Condition of our Acceptance and Juſtification <hi>
                     <ref target="#A29503-NOTEF">(f)</ref>.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:104491:105"/>
               <p> Theſe are all of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinions and Doctrines of the Jewiſh Doctors, or Expounders of the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law concerning Juſtification, that I at preſent remember. Now all theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Jewiſh Doctors put together, are the <hi>Juſtification by the Law, or the Works of the Law,</hi> as I conceive. Which, in not many words, are to this effect. Some men needed no Juſtification, but thoſe who did, were juſtified without any Merits but their own; <hi>viz.</hi> for the due Obſervance of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by their own Strength, Care and Induſtry.</p>
               <p>Juſtification then by Faith, or according to the Chriſtian Doctrine, as oppoſed to the Law, muſt be on the contrary. That all men being ſinners are juſtified, and particularly receive remiſſion of ſins, the Holy Spirit and Everlaſting Salvation, from the free and undeſerved goodneſs of God, upon the conſideration of the perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the meritorious Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, and upon the Condition or Qualification of a pious Temper of Heart for the future, to obey the Will of God, (and conſequently to do the thing that is right and juſt) howſoever he ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to declare it; but particularly by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; which very Condition
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104491:105"/> too we had never been able to perform, without the aſſiſtance of the grace of God. This, as I think, may be the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Senſe of Juſtification by Faith; but if it ſhould prove otherwiſe, it is but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the ſignification of a Phraſe, I confeſs obſcurely enough delivered to us now at this diſtance of time, and of ſo different a way of ſpeaking from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Age. However that be, certain it is, that the Doctrine it ſelf is taken out of, and according to the Holy Scriptures; in which I ſee nothing but what is plain, eaſie and reaſonable. After this, we may in very ſhort obſerve, that if any of the three Senſes of <hi>juſtifying faith</hi> mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> A general Piety, or a Chriſtian Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or according to the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, be that of the Holy Scripture, then juſtifying Faith is not a meer aſſent to the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel; nor, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> is it a bare reliance upon God and Chriſt, and truſt in their promiſes; or as others expreſs it, a rolling and throwing our ſelves upon Chriſt, for pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; nor, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> is it a confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that our ſins are pardoned in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; nor, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> is it whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men have confuſedly meant by thoſe Metaphors of going to Chriſt, or embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104491:106"/> Chriſt, or eying him by Faith as an inſtrument; as if ſuch a thin <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile Relation of Faith were a thing for which Faith ſhould be ſo much predicated, and to which no leſs than Juſtification, and Eternal Salvation ſhould be attributed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if Faith ſhould thus juſtifie, becauſe it apprehends, takes hold of, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Chriſt, how much more ſhould love be ſaid to do it; which more properly may be ſaid to take hold of, and embrace Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> There is no mention in the Scripture of Faith's juſtifying or ſaving, as ſuch a kind of inſtrument, nor of any thing which infers it, or would ſo much as give any hint or ſuſpicion of it; but as a neceſſary Condition or Qualification every where, in the ſame manner as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Obedience, Confeſſion of Sins, and believing him to be raiſed from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9, 10. Both theſe laſt are Synecdochically taken, for being true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or Obedience to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe notions, I conceive, have been invented and received principally in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Pontifician ſenſe; and then, for want of the knowledge of the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal way of ſpeaking, or from former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104491:106"/> Such notions and language would have ſeemed very ſtrange and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Greek, the Roman, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Jew, the Adverſary of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom he endeavours to convince and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, and when underſtood very mean and improbable. And yet there may be truth under all theſe expreſſions, if they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken figuratively with ſome ſort of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and we may be ſo charitable as to believe, that pious and good Men have ſo underſtood them; and that others ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times can better tell, and explain their thoughts, than they themſelves. As for example, if we take Faith firſt ſtrictly for an Aſſent, but then add, ſo firm, repeated, attentive and deliberate an one, like that of <hi>Thomas,</hi> as to produce in us profound veneration and ſubmiſſion of Soul to God and Chriſt, and an actual Obedience to their Will and Commands, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a true Vertue and real San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of Heart and Life; I ſay, if this be the Senſe of juſtifying Faith, it is true and good; and ſo if believing and relying upon Chriſt, and truſt in him for pardon of ſin and acceptance, be not a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous one, but well grounded upon a true Repentance, the real Change and Converſion of the Heart, and ſuppoſing

               <p>We have now gone through the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the words promiſed.

What can intercept or reſtrain his Magnificent goodneſs to his Friends whom he delights in, and delights to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? And then our Conſciences will not terrify us, or make us uneaſie with Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Suſpicions of our Guilt, and his Juſtice one Day, and drive us from all thoughts of God. But on the contrary, they will invite, encourage, command us to make uſe of him, to make him our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, our Truſt, our Solace in all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at all times. Then, when all the World, as kindly as it may now look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, ſhall neglect us, or forſake us, or hate us, or (which is certain to come to paſs ſooner or later) ſhall not be able in the leaſt to help us though it would; then when Death ſhall enviſage and ſummon us to an appearance before that Sovereign Tribunal, and when we ſhall ſtand there to receive our final Doom, and irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sentence.</p>

               <p> Oh, moſt deſirable and happy of all Conditions! without the aſſurance of which if we would draw our Curtains about us, and be ſerious but one hour, we could not be quiet or eaſie in our ſelves.

Even the continuance of bodily Life and Health, the greateſt bodily Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are out of their Power; but how much more the goods of the mind, and the Treaſures of Heaven. Whereas the Eternal Sovereign Lord of the Univerſe, hath all things perfectly at his own diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, to beſtow upon whom he pleaſeth; and that here with the Wiſdom and Care of a Father, but hereafter certainly Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy and Pleaſures for ever more.

The other, that their own good Works both of Duty and Choice, of Precept and Charity, were abundantly meritorious, and by their Worth and Merit did expiate all their ſins, and oblige God in Juſtice to forgive them,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104491:113"/> and receive them into his Favour again; of which more in the next particular. Wee'll here add ſomewhat more. In the Author of <hi>Eccleſ.

                  <p>'Tis true, the Holy Scripture it ſelf telleth us, that God did oft-times do good to Men, yea, and forgive ſome puniſhments of ſome ſins, for the ſake, and at the requeſt of ſome other eminently, holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Man; (ſo <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Steward was bleſſed for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſake; the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at <hi>Moſes</hi>'s humble Requeſt were ſpared; the <hi>Sodomites</hi> for ten Righteous Perſons at the requeſt of <hi>Abraham,</hi> had eſcaped that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Deſtruction) and we believe he doth

                  <p>In their own Books it is common, that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall have a portion in the World to come, that not one of them ſhall periſh, or go to Hell, except Apoſtates, and ſuch who deny ſome fundamental Articles of their Religion, otherwiſe wicked enough.</p>

                  <p>But if we go further downward among the Fathers, I do not know whether we ſhall learn much concerning this point. Thoſe who pleaſe may try themſelves. <hi>Juſt. Martyr</hi> the Philoſopher ſeems to me to have taken the Notion of it beſt, and St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and St. <hi>Jerome</hi> (in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at leaſt) though worſt, with a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and narrowneſs, common to Perſons of Wit, Eloquence, and Zeal in their own Religion, eſpecially when flouriſhing in Power and Reputation. Such a zeal in ſo truly excellent Religion as the Chriſtian, even when miſtaken, is pardonable: But more acceptable to the wiſer ſort of Men, when attended with Judgment, and a juſt regard to Truth. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſeems to have been a greater Maſter in the Language of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104491:119"/> the Jews, ſo far as Biblical Hebrew and Chaldee went, than in their Opinions, and their Books in which they are contained.</p>
                  <p>And though he may ſometimes mention ſome-what he had learned in converſation with his Maſters, as in his Epiſtle to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſia,</hi> the Collection called <hi>Miſna</hi> (as I think againſt <hi>Morinus)</hi> and a Cuſtom or two of the Jews, and their opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Evangeliſts: Yet I do not know, (perhaps others may know better) whether he hath quoted any one Sentence out of any Jewiſh Book in its own Language. But without doubt there were enough of them in his time to have quoted, and which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame Opinions concerning Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which we have cited in theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, and the Jews teach to this day. Or if St. <hi>Jerome</hi> had read ſuch Books, it ſeems it was not in his thoughts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine in this matter with that of the Jews. Let any one read St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> on <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. St. <hi>Aug.</hi> quaeſt. 80. quaeſt. 73. and <hi>de ſpir. &amp; litera ad Marcell.</hi> and his Expoſ. of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Gal.</hi> and his Book <hi>de fide &amp; operibus,</hi> and others. There may be ſome things very good now and then dropt: But generally what they ſay, is of ſuch confuſed and uncertain Senſe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104491:120"/> (and ſometimes not true) that a man is little the better, but only to know that ſuch men have ſaid ſo.</p>
                  <p>I would not be here thought by this, to deſire the Abatement of the juſt Eſteem of ſo great a Name, as the Fathers. For I believe them to have been generally of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Piety, and the greateſt men of their Ages for knowledge; ſome in one thing, ſome in another, ſome in all; but it cannot be allowed that they were equal either in Philoſophy, the true knowledge, and diſtance of the Natures of things, or in the skill of expounding and interpreting the Holy Scriptures, which this preſent Age by the good Providence of Almighty God doth enjoy. We ſhall, I think be very unjuſt to it, if we do not acknowledge ſo much. May the effect of this our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in knowledge be alſo our improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a ſubſtantially religious and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Temper and Practice; without which it is but diverſion, not buſineſs; that which may pleaſe the Speculators, but profit no body, and nothing mend the State of the World.</p>

               </gap> indeed, the glad Tidings which the Goſpel hath brought to the World. Now do we hear the joyfull News, and the beſt that ever ſounded in the Ears of Mankind. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is only able to ſave or deſtroy us Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, looks towards us with a Countenance full of Compaſſion and good Will.</p>
            <p>Here we have the Completion of that Prophetical Hymn, ſung at the Birth of the Great Jeſus by a Choire of Angels. <hi>Glory be to God on high, on Earth peace, good Will towards men,</hi> and very fitly repeated
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:104491:122"/> by all hearty Chriſtians, whoſe Minds are enlightned, and Hearts ſenſibly touched af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Communion in that Service, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſending of ſuch a Perſon as the Ever-bleſſed Jeſus, and with ſuch a Deſign, would one Day redound to the Glory of the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs, both Heaven and Earth ſounding aloud his Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

            <p>Finally good Will towards Men, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to God's gracious regard, what Acts of Grace and Favour might not Men then expect. Great were the Bleſſings and Benefits now, more eſpecially, which God was preparing for the Sons of mortal and ſinfull Men. Who ought to echo back the

            <p n="1">I. The Act, the Deſign, the Buſineſs to be done, <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſuppoſeth ſome Averſion and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in the Parties to be reconciled, God and the World. The Parties were Enemies. This we ought a little to explain, and ſhew in Propriety of Speech,</p>
            <p>(1) How man was God's Enemy, and (2) how God may be Man's. It needs not much explication or proof, that Mankind hath been, and in greateſt part, ſtill is, the Enemy of God. Enmity imports 2 things:</p>
            <p>(1) A Contrariety of Nature and Will, (2) and more ſtrictly, miſchievous Deſigns,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104491:123"/> Intentions and Actions, according to ones Power. In both theſe reſpects Man was, and is generally, ſtill the Enemy of God. In the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> is an excellent Comment <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12.</note> upon this Enmity, between the Divine Nature and Laws, and the unregenerate Man; for in ſuch Senſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf. And the ſame Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 17.</p>
            <p>The degenerate and regenerate Nature, are contrary one to the other, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 22. <hi>The old Man is corrupt, the new Man is created after God in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Moſt expreſly and plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>The carnal mind is Enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> And the Gentiles (which were almoſt all the World, nor were the generality of the Jews inwardly much better) amongſt other their abominable Qualities, are termed <hi>Haters of God.</hi> Thus we ſee how man is the Enemy of God. But how is God man's Enemy, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſinfull and degenerate Man? (1) It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that God's Nature, Will, and Laws, are as contrary to Man's, as his is to God's. (2) That God hates a ſinfull Nature as ſuch (to ſpeak after the manner
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104491:123"/> of men) infinitely more than the wicked Man doth the holy and pure Nature of God. A wicked man is not ſo perfectly, and in ſo high a Degree wicked and ſinfull, as God is righteous and holy, and ſo it is every where expreſſ'd in the Scripture, God's Soul hates the wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 9. It muſt be acknowledged, (3) that God often treats wicked Men, in ſome reſpects, as a Man uſeth to treat his Enemy. He puniſheth and deſtroys them too, when ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reclaimable. But then, more generally, he uſeth them like one, who beareth their Perſons good Will: for he pities their blindneſs and perverſeneſs, he bears them with the utmoſt Patience; In the midſt of their higheſt Injuries and Provocations, he continues his Bleſſings corporal and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; the good things of this Life oft-times in plenty, and the means of Repentance and Salvation, his word and ſpirit; He in kindneſs chaſtiſeth them to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. All theſe are the Effects of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and love of good Will to them, even while Enemies.</p>
            <p>Indeed, after all this, if they grow ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, obdurate, and contemptuous. He oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times makes them Examples in this World, however in the next. He utterly deſtroys them Body and Soul; not their Being, but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104491:124"/> all for which it is deſirable. But this Treatment proceeds not from any Malice in God againſt their Perſons; but from Love and Care of the reſt of his Creatures. It is only when it becomes neceſſary to the Government of the World; when wicked Men ought not to be any longer born; when their miſchievous Impiety and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample becomes intolerable.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the difference between wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men's Enmity to God, and God's to Men. On God's part what there is, is moſt juſt and neceſſary; but on Man's, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly unjuſt. However an Enmity there is, but not irreconcilable. For God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf. And that's the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Thing: The Author, God. He began the Deſign immediately after the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and degeneracy of Man, and hath been ever ſince proſecuting of it, and that in or by Chriſt too, as we ſhall preſently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and here we are to obſerve, that it is but one of the parties at Enmity, that deſign'd and endeavour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d a Reconciliation, and that is God.</p>
            <p>Stupendious Goodneſs! God, an infinite Majeſty, Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, deſires a Reconciliation with man, the meaneſt of his own reaſonable Creatures;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104491:124"/> God, infinitely holy, wiſe and good; Man unholy, fooliſh and wicked: God negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and forgotten, and moſt part wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, injuriouſly offended, and even inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpis'd: Man, his unnatural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Creature, and Off-ſpring.</p>
            <p>Finally, God Omnipotent, who could have done himſelf right every Moment, cruſh'd this pitifull Worm to dirt, turn'd him out of Being, or into Eternal Miſery; Man who could at his worſt but have wrigled, turned up his blaſphemous Mouth, and contemptible Head againſt Heaven (not without its permiſſion neither) and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſhed in his inveterate Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>'Tis this God, I ſay, who began, and ſtill carries on the Deſign of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with this contemptible and perverſe Enemy, Man: Even ſo far, as to beſeech him to be friends, as it follows in the Verſe after the Text. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt</hi> (and Chriſt is for God) for it is added, <hi>as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead be reconciled to God.</hi> How canſt thou hear ſuch words, O man, and not preſently fall down upon thy Knees, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to prevent, in appearance, ſuch an indecent Condeſcenſion? And doſt thou,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104491:125"/> O Heavenly Father, beſeech me? is it not below thy infinite Majeſty, to be a Suitor to a mean and ſinfull Creature? ſhall a prodigal and rebellious Child ſuffer his wiſe, and good Father, to beg reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation at his hands? nay, ſurely, that part is mine, and only becomes me. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo ſurpriſed with the Humility of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when he would waſh his Diſciples Feet, and ſo offended at it, that he was bold to ſay, He ſhould never waſh his, till our Saviour threatned him into a Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>John</hi> 13. 8.</p>
            <p>In like manner, a good Man, duely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the infinite Diſtance between God and himſelf, and how the Caſe ſtands, may, at firſt ſight, be tempted to think ſo great a Condeſcenſion of God, as Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Peace and Reconciliation with men, ſome-what undecent and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if he himſelf had not expreſly told us otherwiſe, and laid his Commands upon us, not to diſpute his Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>But upon a little Enquiry, he would ſoon find it reaſonable and neceſſary. For alas, as for a great part of Mankind, they were fallen into profound Ignorance of the true God, the Perſon to whom they were to be reconciled, and to whom they were Enemies in their minds by wicked
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104491:125"/> Works, by their degenerate and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature. And though they ſhould have known him, and how the caſe ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, (as we through his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy do:) yet through Perverſeneſs, Pride, Haughtineſs and Licentiouſneſs, natural and affected Delight in evil Temper and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, they would have refuſed his kind Offers, and not have given him the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; like the Barbarous of Mankind, who will not be brought to a civil Life, but chuſe to continue in Naſtineſs, Rudeneſs and Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, mortally hating all thoſe, who would perſwade them to change their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Inſomuch, that it is one of the firſt ſteps of the moſt mercifull Author of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, to bring Men to be willing to hear his Propoſals, and to enter into a Treaty with him. That's the 2<hi>d.</hi> thing obſervable in the words, the Author of this Reconciliation, <hi>God. God was in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third is the Parties to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, God and the World: And here we cannot omit particularly to obſerve two things: (1) the Goodneſs of God. Again, (2) his Condeſcenſion; or, as I think I may be bold truly to call it, his <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Goodneſs of God, that he would be pleaſed to be reconciled at all, that he
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104491:126"/> would vouchſafe to take any courſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Enmity between himſelf and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; that he would contrive and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute (to ſpeak after the manner of men) ſuch a deſign, that man firſt might have no unjuſt Enmity in his Nature againſt him, and then that there might be none in him againſt Man; and that he might not be obliged by his Sanctity, Juſtice, and even Univerſal Goodneſs it ſelf, to uſe him as an Enemy, that there might be ſettled and preſerved, an hearty Amity and Correſpondence between God and Man. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which is here moſt proper, is God's gracious Condeſcenſion, or even <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi> Condeſcenſion to the loweſt Acts of Goodneſs and Charity, where it doth not hinder greater, (as it doth not in God, who is always ſufficient for all kinds and inſtances of it together) is one Branch of Humility; and therefore God may be ſaid, in a moſt proper Senſe to be <hi>humble.</hi> The higheſt doth not think any Office of Goodneſs below him, becauſe it is low, as oft-times proud Man doth. He feedeth the very young Ravens when they cry, and cloatheth the Lilies of the Field.</p>
            <p>But there is another more general No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Humility,</hi> which may moſt truly be
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104491:126"/> attributed to God himſelf, and that is, not to eſteem or uſe any Power <hi>ultimately</hi> for it ſelf, as to be feared or honoured for it.</p>
            <p>This is the true general Notion of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;</hi> and then there is nothing more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, than that God is the moſt humble of all Beings. He doth nothing <hi>merely and ultimately,</hi> for the Oſtentation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his Power and Greatneſs: He va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues his Power only as directed by his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for the Ends of Goodneſs, as their Inſtrument of doing good. His Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his Creatures is neceſſary for their Government, and for the moſt happy State of them all: If God could not controul Angels and Men, reward and puniſh the good and bad as he pleaſeth, the World would be all Miſery and Confuſion. But contrary-wiſe, Pride, the oppoſite to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which is to love and deſire Power for it ſelf; an Affectation to do what one liſts, Good or Evil; to have all others Wills and Actions at our command; to ſtrut and ſwell with it; to make all know it, which may be in doing miſchief, as well as good; all this, I ſay, hath no place in Heaven. It dwells only in Earth and Hell. The good Angels imitate their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and theſe mighty and powerfull Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ſo humble, as to be the Servants of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104491:127"/> good Men here below. Whence we Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals may be adviſed, that the Vertue of Humility in general, as mean a thing as it may ſound or ſeem, and that Branch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of Condeſcenſion to the loweſt Acts of Charity and Goodneſs, where it hinders not greater, is an Imitation not only of Angels, but of God Almighty himſelf. But to return to our Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This gracious Condeſcenſion of God may be (if we pleaſe) juſtly raiſed by the diſtinct Conſideration of three things. (1) That he vouchſafes to be reconciled to his own Creatures. There is infinitely greater diſtance between God, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of his Creatures, than there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the greateſt Emperour upon his Throne, and the moſt deſpicable Beggar upon the Dunghill. (2) To the meaneſt of his reaſonable Creatures, and that is Man. It might ſeem more decent to do it to Angels, but to ſuch a contemptible thing as Man is great indeed. <hi>Lord, what is Man, that thou art ſo mindfull of him, and the Son of Man that thou thus vifiteſt him, Pſal.</hi> 8. 4. And (3) to Man ſo mean a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet ſo proud and willfull a ſinner as ſome are at leaſt in great Degree, (and the worſt are not excepted) who careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and contemptuouſly, continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104491:127"/> him, who defie him, proclaim War againſt him, and are reſolved to perſiſt and die in their Rebellion, and Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But we leave theſe things to further Meditation.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The 4<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> obſervable in the Text, is the Inſtrument of Reconciliation, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom God makes uſe of in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Counſel, and Deſign of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and that is <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

               </gap>]. So we have it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> rendred <hi>by</hi> him all that believe are juſtified. Here might be a large Field of Diſcourſe, by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larizing the manner and method, which Jeſus Chriſt, God's Meſſenger to Mankind, ſent to effect and execute this Deſign of Reconciliation, makes uſe of: We ſhall at preſent do little more than name them. The (1) with which God by Jeſus Chriſt begun the Execution of his Deſigns, was the miraculous Hiſtory of Chriſt, from and before his Birth, to his ſending the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gift of the Holy Ghoſt. This was all along the moſt evident Proof of his Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Commiſſion, from God for this Affair, and it was neceſſary in order to his entring upon, and continuing his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. (2) The 2<hi>d.</hi> was his Doctrine.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104491:128"/> Here Jeſus was to explicate, open and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Meſſage and Buſineſs more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and diſtinctly. He was to tell them who and what he was, from whom he came, his Relation to Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that He was the one only true God, infinitely great, holy and juſt; but above all, good, mercifull, compaſſionate, infinitely deſirous of their Welfare, and that they might be ſaved, or be the Objects of his Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Delight, not of his Juſtice and unavoidable Severity, that he was their Maker and Father; that he would not only receive their Return and Submiſſion with Joy, but effectually help and aſſiſt them in it. Such a taking and moving Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God, is that of the Parable of the Prodigal. He was more-over to acquaint them with the conditions and terms of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which were Repentance, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Obedience, humble Submiſſion, and ſincere Application for pardon, and that for the Sake, and upon the Account of himſelf, or of what he was appointed by God to do and ſuffer, the Conſequence of their accepting or refuſing the Condition ſo graciouſly offered by God. All this was done in his Precepts, Promiſes, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: And thus far the Application was made immediately to Man, to take away
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104491:128"/> the Enmity that was in his Nature and Will to God, and to qualifie him for the Amity and Friendſhip of God. The (3) of theſe means of Reconciliation, was his Merit and Oblation of himſelf as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: His moſt exactly vertuous, holy and perfectly obedient Life to God, and being an Univerſal Sacrifice for all Mankind, who had been Offenders. By the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Conſideration of theſe, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Juſtice, Clemency and Wiſdom of God, to be mercifull and benevolent to rebellious Mankind, in all theſe Inſtances, preſently to be mentioned: That is, it was the wiſeſt way, and of beſt effect to the World, better than to have been reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without it. And this part of the means reſpecting God immediately, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Enmity on his ſide, that he might be juſt, and yet not caſt away all kindneſs and care, even of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Man; but particularly be the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifier of all them that believe, who ſhould now become dutifull and obedient to God, by Jeſus Chriſt. We may add to theſe a fourth, and that is the continual Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, by which he ſtill carries on the reconciling Deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the World. For I make account that his Interceſſion in Heaven,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104491:129"/> reacheth as far as his Propitiation here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; that is, to the whole World, bad and good, unconverted and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, impenitent and penitent. For the impenitent he interceeds to God for his patience and forbearance, and his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Bleſſings inward and outward: All the means of Repentance and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them, ſo long as God in his infinite Wiſdom ſhall think fit. For the penitent and good he interceeds for their general Pardon, upon their general Repentance, and particular when they fall into any ſin. He interceeds alſo for their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, advance and perſeverance in their Duty and Obedience to God, that they might be preſerved through God's Power and Care, through Faith unto Salvation, and finally, at laſt, be put into poſſeſſion of immortal Bliſs, be with him where he is, and ſee and partake of his Glory.</p>
            <p>V. The laſt obſervable in the Text is, one principal Effect of God's Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz. Not impating their Treſpaſſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi> I call it but one, becauſe there are ſeveral others, as we ſhall preſently ſhew. More-over, this is an Effect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which muſt neceſſarily be preceded by others, and without which this will never follow. For it is not ſo
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104491:129"/> well ſaid by ſome very learned Men, (as it ſeems to me) that <note place="margin">Grot. Satisf. &amp; Outr. de Sacrif.</note> there are ſeveral Degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, as it would, that there are ſeveral Degrees, or rather Effects of Reconciliation. Suſpenſion of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not remiſſion. Some of theſe muſt go before the other. Let us ſee them in order briefly. (1) The firſt Effect of God's Reconciliation to the World, is his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and Long-ſuffering; not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeizing and bringing Sinners to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſtrikes not immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Indignities and Provocations, and not only ſo, but during this time of his Patience, affords them the Obligations, Means, Helps and Aſſiſtances of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation. Such are all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings, his holy Word and Spirit, the Examples of holy and vertuous Men, who by theſe means have been converted, and ſome of them perhaps irreſiſtibly on purpoſe, that they might be the means of others Converſion or Confirmation, and Improvement in Goodneſs. All this we all owe to the Merits, Oblation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. I ſay all, both bad and good, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe who generally live according to the Fleſh, who are under the Power of Luſts and inordinate Appetite,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104491:130"/> and thoſe who live according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who are generally governed by their Conſcience, the Fear and Love of God, a Divine Principle inſpired or commanded by the Holy Spirit. The bad are almoſt perpetual Sinners, the beſt in this Life are not altogether without Sin; the bad live in Sin, the good are ſometimes over-taken by it. Now it may be truly ſaid, that it is for Chriſt's Sake, that God is ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the World by him, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the preſent Execution of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or puniſhment, and to continue the motives and means of better Behaviour; that he waits a bad Man's general, and a good Man's particular Repentance; that he gives time and means for the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the one, and recovery of the other. (2) A 2<hi>d.</hi> Effect of God's Reconciliation, is pardon of ſin upon repentance, not without it. Upon our Sanctification by the due uſe of the means afforded us, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Juſtification, being favoured by God, and particularly in the Forgiveneſs of paſt ſins. This we ſee in the Effect, eſpecially mentioned in the Text, <hi>not imputing,</hi> &amp;c. but not excluſively of all others. 'Tis that which the Apoſtle thought fit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Jews, with whom his diſpute was about this matter.</p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:104491:130"/>
            <p> The Queſtion between them was, ſince all men are ſinners, as at leaſt the Apoſtle affirmed, how ſhould their Sins be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or their Treſpaſſes not imputed unto them. The Apoſtle tells them, that it was by Jeſus Chriſt; that God was in general reconciling the World to himſelf by Chriſt; and among other Effects of it this was one, more eſpecial and remarkable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of penitent Sinners (none elſe) for Chriſt's Sake.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, we ſee the Apoſtle every where to inſiſt upon this Article: They were to preach among all Nations, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſins; and through this Name is preached to you forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38. A 3<hi>d.</hi> Effect of God's reconciliation, is a good Man's improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in grace and holineſs. As God for Chriſt's ſake is pleaſed to afford men means whereby of bad they may become good, ſo he is pleaſed to continue or augment them, to encreaſe and multiply his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of light, ſtrength, comfort, and joy, in well doing, to make good men better, that they may perſevere and be made more meet ſtill, for converſation with the Saints in light. <hi>4th.</hi> The laſt general Effect of Reconciliation, is Eternal Salvation, a Life immortal without ſin or ſorrow. After
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104491:131"/> the effects of affording means of converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their proving effectual, remiſſion of paſt ſins, and perſeverance in Holineſs, we are to ſee God. God will ſettle us eternally in ſuch a State of Life, where our Aſpires after the ſpiritual Life of Wiſdom, Vertue and Holineſs, which were always here ſtrugling, and ſometimes oppreſſed and maſtered by the inſinuating or boyſterous Affections and Appetites of the carnal Life, ſhall be perfectly gratified, conſtantly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, or without any Enemy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt withall.</p>
            <p>There are yet ſome more particular Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of God's reconciliation taken notice of in the Scripture, ſuch as peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, confidence, and full truſt in God, acceſs with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, a conſtant, comfortable and joyous State of mind, which we leave to reflection and meditation. We have taken occaſion, from one of the principal mention'd in the Text, to reckon up many others, that we may not think it the only one, and at once ſee the mighty Advantages of God's recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and friendſhip by Jeſus Chriſt, and our as great obligations of duty and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them. We ſhall briefly now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all, with an Inference or two, from what hath been obſerved and diſcourſed.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:104491:131"/>
            <p> From hence it follows, that we have a juſt Object of our Admiration and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, the goodneſs of Almighty God, and the bleſſed Jeſus, the Author and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of our Reconciliation; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give this condeſcending goodneſs of theirs too great Names. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks oft of this Love of God, and Chriſt moſt paſſionately. <hi>God commendeth his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. And <hi>God who is rich in mercy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. Our Saviour himſelf in <hi>John</hi> 15. 13. <hi>Greater love than this hath no man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That here we may be duely affected, conſider we the Parties, what God, what we are. (1) God is the Party greatly injured, and moſt unjuſtly provoked by our contemptuous Diſobedience, our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Ingratitude, our contracted Enmity, and Contrariety of Nature to him. God needs us not, our love and ſervice what can it advantage him? Can a man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to God? <hi>Job</hi> 32. 2, 3. God, whoſe Power is irreſiſtible, who can avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon us, when, and as much as he pleaſeth, though all his Creatures ſhould be our Confederates, and undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and protect us. And what (2) are we? the Aggreſſours, the wilfull and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Continuers of this Hoſtility. 'Tis
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104491:132"/> we who are his Creatures, Servants and Children. 'Tis we who are under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Obligations to him, who have received life and breath, and all things from him, and ſometimes the higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Honour and Happineſs in this Life, and preſerved us there in ſafety, againſt all open and ſecret Enemies. 'Tis we whom he hath provided for, maintained, taken care of Souls and Bodies here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 'Tis we who are ſometimes the moſt ungratefull and undutifull, whom he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling to himſelf, and beſeeching us to be reconciled to him too. Finally, 'tis we who are the meaneſt of his rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Off-ſpring of Duſt, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Clay and Dirt, the reverſion of Worms. 'Tis ſuch as we that God is, as it were ſolicitous, to ſave and ſecure from his Anger and Juſtice, by perſwading and aſſiſting us to be reconciled, and to be friends with him. 'Tis not Angels he hath been ſo kind to, for what reaſon his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom beſt knows; but to the Sons of men. And it ſeems as if God were like ſome Parents, moſt indulgent to their youngeſt and weakeſt Children. Oh! the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches of his goodneſs, the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Dimenſions of that love, which paſſeth all underſtanding? what, for the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104491:132"/> Supreme Monarch of the World, whoſe Throne fills the immenſe Spaces of the Univerſe, whoſe Foot-ſtool is paved with Stars, whoſe word immediately flyeth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and pierceth to the Center; at whoſe whiſpers Cherubins and Seraphims cover their Faces, worſhip and obey; for him to deſcend as it were from his Throne to a Worm upon a Mole-hill, to beſeech his Friendſhip, and count his Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to uſe all the gentle ways to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to love, imitate and obey him, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be partaker of his own Nature and Felicity; to leave a Dunghill a mean and ſordid manner of life, and to qualifie and dreſs himſelf for an Eternal Inheritance, Reſidence and Converſation with himſelf in his own Palace? what love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ever heard like this? But 2<hi>d.</hi> it is not enough to wonder at ſo condeſcending goodneſs; but we are to comply with God's Offers of Reconciliation; moſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be friends with him, and embrace the Motion, and induſtriouſly carry on the Deſign without ceaſing, till it be compaſſed and ſecured.</p>
            <p>The motives to this Advice may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to two, (1) the Advantages of God's Friendſhip, (2) the terrible Conſequences of his Enmity.</p>
            <pb n="250" facs="tcp:104491:133"/>
            <p> (1.) The Advantages of his Friendſhip are all the good we are capable of. The Bleſſings of this preſent bodily Life, ſo far as they are good for us, are the meaneſt Effects of his favour; the ſpiritual ones of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Vertue, Goodneſs, Comfort, Joy, and Peace of Conſcience, are greater and nobler; but thoſe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in quality and degree, and duration, are beyond our underſtanding. If God be our Friend, we need not fear the Power and Malice of any; if he be reconciled, he will either cauſe our Enemies to be at peace with, or defend us from them; as if he be our Enemy, he can expoſe us to them. If he love us in Chriſt, who, or what ſhall ſeparate us from it? who ſhall hinder the Fruits and Effects of it? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, with as juſt, as mighty a Triumph, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. But (2) what are the Conſequents of God's Enmity at laſt? In few words, oft-times ſevere Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, in reſpect of this bodily Life, and hardned Heart, and a ſeared Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a reprobate Senſe, to be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, to heap one load of guilt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; to die ſenſleſs without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or with Deſpair and Terrour; and finally, to be condemned publickly to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miſery, without mercy once deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104491:133"/> but now too late ſought after. If theſe things be true, as moſt certainly they are, if Religion and Reaſon are to be believed, then ſurely it is good to be well adviſed be times, to make our peace with God, our Adverſary, while we are in the way, and agree with him upon his own Terms, and whilſt he continues ſuch kind and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offers unto us.</p>
            <p>'Tis too true, that there are too many who will make light of ſuch counſel. And what's the reaſon of it? Is it becauſe they think there is no God; or that he is not powerfull, holy and juſt; or that he is all mercy, or rather ſoftneſs; or that they are well enough with him, and ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him already? no more need to be anſwered to all this, than to ask one queſtion. Suppoſe there were at this time, many ſhrewd Signs of the near Approach of the End of the World, and the Day of Judgment. Suppoſe the Sun and the Moon ſhould ſtand ſtill, as it did upon <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> for a Month inſtead of a Day, and the Sun to go backwards really as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Degrees in the Heavens, as it did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees on the Dial of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> Suppoſe all the Seaſons of the Year Retrograde, or at a ſtand, and the Sun growing pale and ſick,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104491:134"/> as it is ſaid to have been in one of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperour's Time.</p>
            <p>Imagine we a-while from beneath, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Roarings in the Bowels of the Earth, and its lofty and maſſy Structures every where tumbled down, or ſwallowed whole into an Abyſs, the Sea boiling, and the Air filled with fiery and ſulphureous Steams, hideous Storms of Thunder and Lightning, for ſome Days together. Let us Imagine, I ſay, all theſe, and (it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new but what every one talks of) would the Men of Infidelity, Security and Bravery, be then of the ſame Opinion they are now? would they then queſtion whether there was a God, and a great, juſt, and terrible one too? would they then think their Caſe well enough, and dare to expect the Univerſal Judgment, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with the ſame Unconcernedneſs and Confidence that they now pretend to?</p>
            <p>Should we not rather ſee all but a few penitent, ſincerely, vertuous Souls, who were indeed at peace with God through Chriſt, and lived conſtantly in love and duty to him. I ſay, ſhould we not ſee all the reſt, except this ſmall Number, with trembling Hearts, miſgiving, accuſing and condemning Conſciences, crowding to the Churches and Altars; nay, every where, in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104491:134"/> Streets and Fields crying for mercy, and moſt humbly begging for Forgiveneſs and Favour? what would they refuſe to be, or do, ſo they might have but a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous look from an angry God, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Saviour? and yet, perhaps, when they ſhould find all this to prove a Miſtake, and their Panick fears over, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to be the ſame they were before, and live as careleſly, and contemptuouſly, of God's moſt gracious Offers of Peace and Friendſhip, as ever, be as unbelieving, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and confident, as they were in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> till Death or Judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come upon them, when all Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Mercy, Deſigns and Conditions of Reconciliation are at an End. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, hence it appears, how little reaſon they have for their preſent Infidelity, Careleſneſs and Preſumption; what they would do then, they ſhould do now. It is really as true now, that they ought to take care without delay, and to be well aſſured of being reconciled to God by Chriſt, as it will be, when God ſhall come to judge the World by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It remains only then to renew the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to repeat the Exhortation, to embrace and purſue our Reconciliation to God, with all due Thankfulneſs, and Senſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104491:135"/> of the Divine Goodneſs, with all Diligence and Induſtry. If God be in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World to himſelf, I think, we may ſay, it is our Duty and Intereſt to be reconciling God in Chriſt to our ſelves alſo by Repentance, and conſtant future Obedience; and in order thereto, by effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually making uſe of thoſe means, Jeſus Chriſt hath left us for that purpoſe; his holy Doctrine and Example for our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and encouragement; his holy Spirit for our Aſſiſtance; his meritorious Life and Death for our comfort, ſatisfaction and aſſurance. And in his ſtead it is, as the meaneſt of his Embaſſadours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Duty and Truſt, we beſeech, and earneſtly pray, all to be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
